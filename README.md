    abstract = "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown a tremendous capacity for generating literary text. However, their effectiveness in generating children{'}s stories has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this study, we evaluate the trustworthiness of children{'}s stories generated by LLMs using various measures, and we compare and contrast our results with both old and new children{'}s stories to better assess their significance. Our findings suggest that LLMs still struggle to generate children{'}s stories at the level of quality and nuance found in actual stories.",
