But no one in the kingdom knew about the new clothes, so they couldn\u2019t tell the emperor how great they looked and the emperor began to feel embarrassed.\n\nOne day, two traveling salesmen heard about the emperor\u2019s new clothes and decided to make a visit to the kingdom. The salesmen promised the emperor that they could make him a brand new outfit that would be much better than any clothes he had ever worn. The emperor agreed, so the salesmen set off to get the materials to make the new clothes.\n\nA few days later, the salesmen returned with the material and the emperor tried on the new clothes. Everyone in the kingdom was invited to the palace to see the emperor wearing his wonderful new outfit. But no one could see the clothes because they weren\u2019t there. The emperor was so embarrassed and just as the salesmen predicted, he was very proud of his new clothes. \n\nThe Emperor's New Clothes is a great example of how pride can be dangerous. The emperor was so proud of his new clothes that he didn\u2019t realize no one could see them. His pride caused him to feel embarrassed and foolish when no one else recognized them. \n\nThe moral of the story is that it is not always wise to be too proud. Even if something is new or different, it does not necessarily mean it is better. It is important to use common sense and evaluate a situation objectively.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

As he wandered through the forest, he came across a strange black creature. He was scared of it, but also drawn to it. It was the Shadow, who had also been watching him from the shadows. The Shadow revealed that it could make some of Peter's wishes come true, if he was brave enough to accept its help. Peter thought long and hard before finally agreeing. The Shadow then granted Peter a magical gift - the ability to move silently through the shadows. Peter was amazed and thanked the Shadow, before running off into the night.

Little did Red Riding-Hood know that the wolf was actually heading to her grandmother's house to disguise himself as her grandmother and scare her. \n\nWhen Red Riding-Hood arrived at her grandmother's house, she was stopped by the wolf. The wolf demanded to know why Red Riding-Hood was visiting her grandmother and asked for her to bring him the grandmother's signature recipe of baked goods. Red Riding-Hood nervously agreed and ran off to find her grandmother. \n\nLittle Red Riding-Hood eventually found her grandmother and gave her the wolf's request. Her grandmother was confused but gave Red Riding-Hood the recipe anyway and instructed her to be careful on her way back. Red Riding-Hood was then on her way to deliver the treat to the wolf. \n\nWhen Red Riding-Hood arrived at the wolf's house, he was pleased to receive the treat. He greedily devoured the treat and then devoured Red Riding-Hood. Luckily, Little Red Riding-Hood was able to scream loud enough for a woodcutter to come to her rescue. The woodcutter then killed the wolf and Red Riding-Hood was able to make it to her grandmother's house safely.

The wolf then took advantage of her lack of judgement and ate her grandmother before her very eyes. Little Red Riding Hood was so horrified that she ran away screaming, and eventually her cries were heard by a woodcutter who came to her aid. \n\nWith the help of the woodcutter, Little Red Riding Hood was able to outwit the wolf and eventually make it to her grandmother's house unscathed.

She usually walked to visit her sick grandmother every day, but one day, she was running late and couldn't make it in time. \n\nLittle Red Riding Hood came across a wolf on her way, and the wolf asked her all sorts of questions about her plans and what she was bringing to her grandmother. When she said she was bringing her a basket of food, the wolf was pleased and told her that he was too, and then asked her to grab him a cup of sugar from her grandmother's house. \n\nLittle Red Riding Hood was frightened, but she was also curious, and as the wolf was dressed nice and clean, she thought it was her grandmother's friend and didn't worry. \n\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood arrived at her grandmother's house, the wolf had made himself comfortable by the fire, just as if he was a guest. Little Red Riding Hood was relieved until the wolf asked for the sugar. \n\nLittle Red Riding Hood thought for a moment and then remembered her grandmother's special wooden spoon. She ran to get it and when she returned, the wolf had eaten her grandmother and was getting ready to eat her. \n\nBut suddenly, the wolf was met with a wall of wood as the door opened, and there stood Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother, with a big smile on her face and a bouquet of flowers in hand. \n\nLittle Red Riding Hood was relieved, but she was glad she was brave and stood up to the wolf, and she is proud of herself even to this day. \n\nThe moral of the story is that being brave in the face of danger is an honorable quality and one for which you should be proud.

He had never seen anything so beautiful before.

But when he did, the door silently opened and he saw a magnificent castle inside. He was so amazed and afraid at the same time that he couldn't move. But then he remembered that brave little moles never give up and he stepped into the castle.\n\nAs the door closed behind him, he noticed a sparkly vase on a stand in the middle of a grandiose hallway. He walked up to it, and suddenly, he was zapped by a mysterious ray that transported him to a magical world.\n\nHe found himself in a whimsical kingdom, full of wonders and wonders of wonder. He met many quirky creatures and saw some incredible sights. But in the midst of all this amazement, there was one creature who seemed to stand out from the rest.\n\nIt was a beautiful butterfly, and when Fred saw it he knew that he had to get back home as quickly as possible to tell everyone about this incredible place. He returned to the vase and, poof, he was back in his own forest, safe and sound.\n\nFred quickly ran back to the grand opening he had seen, and low and behold, there was the same mysterious door. He opened it, and sure enough, it led to the same magical kingdom.\n\nFred was so excited to now be able to explore this incredible place and spread the word to all his friends about this hidden world.

They went further than they had the day before, and this time they found a beautiful lake. \n\nAs they stood on the shore, admiring the beauty of the lake, Frank suddenly had an idea. He looked at Daffy and said, \u201cLet\u2019s sail across the lake!\u201d Daffy was skeptical at first, but Frank quickly reassured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I promise I won\u2019t let anything bad happen.\u201d \n\nSo, with a small sailboat that Frank had found on the beach, the two friends set off across the lake.

Every day, they would wander around in the jungle, looking for things to explore and new adventures to have. \nOne day, Mrs. Elephant saw a mysterious creature, an iguana, and the family decided to follow it in the hopes of finding out where it was going. The Iguana led them on a long and treacherous journey, across treetops and deep into the jungle. Along the way, the family encountered many strange and wonderful creatures, from a giant bird that carried them across the sky to a fierce tiger that they had to outrun. Eventually, they found themselves at the edge of the jungle, facing a large mountain. \nThe Iguana had led them to the top of the mountain, where they could see for miles in all directions. It was so high they could have jumped off and flown away! But Mrs. Elephant decided that it was time to go back home and the family all turned around and began their journey back. They were now more familiar with the rules of the jungle, they had learned new things, and they would remember this journey for the rest of their lives. \n \nThe next time you hear a story, think of the Just So Stories.

Jack had a very curious and adventurous spirit, but his adventures often went wrong. Jack was always looking for new challenges, but his parents were afraid something terrible would happen. \n\nOne winter, Jack heard about a mysterious forest that no one had ever explored. It was said to be full of magical creatures and plants that could cure any illness. Jack wanted to explore it, but his parents were too scared to let him go. So, on a cold winter night, Jack decided to slip away and explore the forest himself. \n\nWhen Jack arrived, he was amazed by the beauty of the forest. He had expected to find magical creatures, but instead he found a large man-made castle towering above the trees. As he approached the castle, he realized he was in trouble. The castle was locked and there was no way to open it. \n\nHe turned around in the hopes of finding a way out of the forest, when suddenly he heard a loud noise coming from within the castle walls. He looked in and saw hundreds of strange creatures that looked like people, but they were all frozen in a deep sleep. Jack soon realized that the castle was a giant glacier and the creatures were all dreaming of adventuring in the mysterious forest. \n\nJust then, a mysterious force awakened Jack and pointed him in the right direction. Jack followed the force as it lead him ever deeper into the glacier. Finally, he reached the end and he found a beautiful village hidden beneath the glacier.\n\nThe people of the village welcomed him and said they had been waiting for him for a very long time. Jack was the one they had been preparing for, the one who would save their village from a terrible fate. \n\nIt turns out, the glacier was about to melt, and if it didn't, the entire village would be wiped out. Jack quickly worked with the villagers to build a shelter, gather supplies, and prepare for the incoming heat. \n\nThe day the glacier melted, everyone gathered around the village to watch the spectacle. The sun melted away the ice and revealed a beautiful meadow with a golden stream running through it. The people of the village cheered and welcomed Jack as their savior. \n\nFrom then on, stories of Jack's heroic deeds were passed down through generations. And to this day, whenever it snows, the people of the village gather around to tell the story of 1800 and the frozen glacier.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
