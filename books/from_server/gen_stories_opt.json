The\nweather had been so very cold, that the Queen feared she had a fever, when a\nlittle bird sang sweetly in her garden. The Queen knew who it was from the\npleasant voice, for she heard it sing many times. She had always thought it\nwas a sweet bird, and had never meant to harm it, but the poor little bird\nnever came near the palace garden any more. It was too cold for it in the\ngreat bitter north wind.\n\nWhile the Queen looked out for her little bird; which she knew very well\nfrom its voice, she saw, through the window, a little bundle of dressed cloth\non the ground. She saw also, close by, a little golden egg, covered\nwith sweet smelling scent. She lifted up the cloth, and found under it a\nlittle grey and black roebuck fawn. The Queen was so happy to see this\nlittle one, that she put it in a little basket, and went and gave her to the\nlittle golden egg, which sat in the middle of the royal garden with its\nbright lamp burning. Some wise men visited the Golden Egg, and were told by\nthe little golden bird, that it had found the little fawn as the little\nbirds' master had gone to the north. The wise men told the King, that his\nwife had found this little fawn because she had taken a great compassion on\nit, giving the little one into its hands.\n\nThe Princess, who had come out to feed the cows and the sheep, saw\nsomething shining. It was the little basket, and she went to her mother. She\nsaid, \"Mother, have you brought a little wild fawn home with you?\" Then\nher mother told her that yes, she had found a little wild fawn tied up in a\nlittle handkerchief, just when she had gone looking for a little bird in the\ngardens to sing to her.\n\nWhen he heard his wife's words, the King took the wild fawn and put it\ninto a wooden house, and went across the wide forests to the north, where he\ntold his wife of this gift of God, but the Princess did not know her father\nto mean that he also had found a little fawn. When the young King came\nback, he was astonished to see the wild little fawn in his wooden house,\nand when he had taken off the head and beard, and saw the young roebuck fawn,\nthe tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nNow when the Queen was at her sewing, nobody could get any word from her\nunless from the window; but the baby, the baby sat on its mamma's knee,\nand always tried to speak, but could not make out what the old men and\nwomen were talking about. After a while they stopped, and the baby heard no\nmore, and it grew too old to be able to speak, and was called Master\nFawn. The King's son saw little Master Fawn, and called often to his father\nto come and see the little one. The King sent for his old men, and told them\nall what had happened, and they set out with Master Fawn, and when they came\nto the palace, it pleased the King and Queen very much to see little Master\nFawn. They dressed it up, as the most glorious little fawn they had ever\nseen. They dressed it up in clothes of beautiful cloth and embroidery,\nembroided with fine gold and silver. They gave it golden earrings and a lovely\nbow of the finest wire, and they set before it a little chair with a gilt\nseat, and painted it with little flowers. The King let its head rest in his\nhand, and the Queen said it was so beautiful she had hardly ever seen such\na little fawn. The King took up the little chair, and sat it by his side, as\nhe was accustomed when hunting. And then they put the roebuck fawn down, and\nwent to the garden to play on the grass. The Princess put a little green\nstraw in the corner of her mouth, and hung half an apple down her side, just\nas the birds in their nests eat. Master Fawn looked very well in its new\nclothes, and every one said it really looked very delicate and fragile, but\nthe little roebuck fawn hardly noticed the difference, and ran about in\nthe garden trying to get at the apples.\n\nWhile Master Fawn was playing in the tall grass with the other fawns, a\nlittle golden bird came calling in the garden.

He was feeling playful, and he laughed\nwhen he tasted the chewy, golden flesh, reminding her of the long nights\nshe spent hunting for nuts.\nOne day, the Queen asked her husband why he sat in the courtyard all day,\ndrinking coffee and playing with his children.

No other wall in all the kingdom could fill up this vacuum\nbetter, she would think, than a portrait of her husband, sitting upon a\npile of furs embroidered with silver. The Queen didn't know why, but she\ndidn't miss them one bit.\n\nThere was a window in the Queen's chambers (she was an alchemist, in,\nindeed, everything) where the snow outside was always floating.

The Queen looked at her hands for a moment, then went to the\nfurnace and looked closely at the flames. For a moment she seemed to\nbe thinking very hard. Finally she took one step closer to the fire while,\nsimultaneously, she glanced up at the window and saw that the window was\nopen, very wide. \"He lives up above at the top of the castle on the\npeaks, you know,\" the Queen smiled. \"He has a beautiful room over\nthere.\" She dropped her hands to her sides while she stared at the\nwindow. \"The thing about the peaks is\u2014there really is no\n'up'\u2014except, perhaps, when you decide you're ready.\" The Queen smiled a\nlittle, and then she bent down. \"My apologies,\" she said, \"but you\nmust hurry, dear.

Now the fairies had arranged that she should wear\nwhite in the dark and black at noon-day, the reverse of White-face's\ncolour, and before she brought all the water they begged her to break\na mirror, which, they said, she would lose if she did not. So the\nchild went back to the room and broke a mirror, which frightened her for\nlife. When she came back the Fairies said that she had taken the maiden\nwhite and taken the black maiden on in dark.

It was just\ntwenty days since that eventful evening in the town, and the King and Queen\nhad decided that the fair Princess would not live to witness her fifth birthday,\nwhich was to be in three days. They sent a strong man after her but he\nwas too slow. After the lapse of three weeks, however, they sent another\nstrong man; and, after another three weeks, one still stronger.

Then she said to her\ndaughter:\n\n    \"Come and fetch the white pepper.\"\n    Her daughter went and brought it; but when Snow-White saw it, she\ndropped the white pepper and held the black one in her hand; then the\nred blood began to flow and boil, so that all the mirror-wood, which was\nvery white, blushed, and the drops fell upon the snow.\n\nThe King looked out, and saw what had happened, and told his wife to tell\nher daughter not to boil the white pepper, but to dip it into some fresh\nwater, that all the drops might be wiped off. But the next time she was\ntold to boil it, she dipped the black pepper into the water, and in the\nend she destroyed the whole mirror with the blood of her mother.\n\nOn another occasion, the Queen, her daughters, and some other people were\nsat by a river-side. The Queen said to her two daughters, the elder of\nwhom was named Snow-White:\n\n    \"Bless us, children, it is very cold. Go, call the servants,\nand ask them to make some hot coffee.\"\n    But she thought no longer, but she called all the servants and\nsaid:\n\n    \"Servants, make some hot coffee.\"\n\nThen the younger of the two sisters went and opened the pan of white coffee,\nand, thinking only of the heat it would make, she left the coffee-grounds\nbehind; but there were none in the pan of black coffee. She then stood at a\nlittle distance from the pan; for she did not wish to burn herself, but\nher hands were colder than the coffee, so then her hands turned red and turned\nblack; and when the coffee began to boil, it turned blood-red, and when\nthe blood had boiled through the copper, the whole pan turned into blood.\n\nOne day Snow-White and her sisters were in a wood carrying wood.
