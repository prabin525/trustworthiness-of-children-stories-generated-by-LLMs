'Whatever amuses you, I care not for it. A man needs only to hold fast to the bottom below and the wings above; then, if you like, let your heads bob about as they will.'\nSo the little fishies stopped and took off their hats-- but they had something to complain of.\nThe fishies had found a wonderful piece of wood on the shore, which they called Norway-pine.\nThere were grains growing on it which they could eat, and buds which they could suck; and they could sit on it, and hang about it, and make it their home.\nAnd what did the Water-rat do? He came down to have a look at the new piece of wood. And the little fishies stayed to have a look too, for now was the time when they wished to know whether there was anything that might hinder their making Norway-pine their home. For after all, said they, you know, their mother is not dead, but has gone to a friend who lives one thousand miles away, in the water; and when the little fishies left the wood, they were all taken up in nets and shipped up to the friend.\nNow, when the little fishies found this out, they were very sad, and they said to one another: 'We had better not come back to this wood.'\n'Come back!' said the Water-rat. 'Why should you not stay here? As well sit on this wood, and suck the buds off it, as on any other. Come, now, let us get busy and make you a house.'\n'We shall never be able to do that,' said the little fishies. 'You see, our heads are on this side, and our tails on that; so there is no room for us to hang it on; if we move them up it only makes our heads fall off!'\nBut the Water-rat took one of his long claws and drew them up so that he could put his teeth into their heads or tails, so as to make them hang on. And then they set to work to build the house; and when it was all up the little fishies stayed in it and found very comfortable and warm quarters; and they said it was so, and could not be better, and that they never should want to leave it again.\nAnd their mother, when she heard how comfortable they were, was so delighted with them, that she started all the way to their island just to see them. But when she got there she was met by an arch-villain who did not want his island, for he had never known any such a place. And when the little fishies saw him, they hid themselves in the house, and let their mother go in by the door. And when she came in some of the little fishies went out and told her all that they had discovered. And they said that being so comfortably housed was such a great deal of fun that they should never need to go out into the dark and stormy sea any more.\n'But who is this other arch-villain?' said their mother. 'What name have you given him?'\n'His name is Hunger,' they said.\nThe little fishies thought very deeply about that, and said to their mother: 'It is not always only we who are hungry.'\n'I know that,' said their mother; and then the story goes on as follows.\nEvery year the Water-rat makes a feast for his friends, and with the help of his tail he makes the fires, because he knows how to do that. Other wise the feast would never have been. And then, always too, if the little fishies would only join in it, they should be sure to have a grand time. But they all know that their little heads are too narrow, and that if they should choose to leave off making the Fire-stick and join in the feast they should fall over and bang their own heads, and they would all die of a brain-fever.\nSo the Water-rat goes about getting all the heads he can in order to make the feast. But you know every time the heads get together without their tails, their tails grow very small and they never wear them any more, and, instead of helping each other, they begin to quarrel at once.\n\nThen the Water-rat said to them one day:--\n'If you want to eat at a feast, you must do so together, for this feast is to be a great one. So come with me now and I will show you how.'\nSo the little fishies put on their broadest heads and their longest tails and followed the Water-rat.

When he came forth he gave three shrieks, or four or five; but then he stood back in the water and commenced to eat the first thing in the way of food he met with. Before long, however, he stood up again, and swam out into the sea. The fishermen began to laugh at him, and called him a rat because a long time had elapsed since he had his last meal.\n\"To-day it will rain!\" said the old Water-rat; for, as I said, it was his habit to say what he thought, as well as to think what he says--though a rat he was neither more nor less.\nFor a while the fishermen chaffed him for a rat. But they soon remembered that he had not given them any water to drink for many days: they were not so silly as to drink a hole-maker's water when they had a better.\n\"Are you going to give us a pint of water to drink?\" they laughed. And the Water-rat answered that the rain would soon be falling. They listened a moment, and then they understood that his words were true.\nWhen it did rain, and they were wet through, they at once ordered the Water-rat to put out a pint of water for them to drink. When he came with his water from his hole it was cold and dry, and he was treated as a fool for saying it would rain. But they did their work in the rain; and in what matters they worked hard the Water-rat never had any doubt. \"If I have said that things will come to pass,\" said he to himself, \"then they are certain to come to pass; and what a good observer I must be to know that.\"\nIt had rained before the rain was half over, and the rats began to sing, though their words were no better than most water-rats. But they sang so merrily that the fish were frightened out of their holes by the sound of it. Then the rain began to fall in such vast quantities that it seemed as if the world were being quenched.\nThe old Water-rat, who was often to be seen when the rain was falling, stood in the water and thought. \"To-morrow,\" said he to himself, \"the sun shines.\" On bright days of this sort he used to keep on his topmost hide. If a ray of the sun fell on him, his eyes would sparkle; and he would stop and stay in the water as if he were afraid of the sunlight. He would sometimes swim up close by the men they were catching fish with nets or spears; and he would let the nets slip off the hooks and swallow the fish at an unguarded moment.\nWhen the rain began to fall more heavily the Water-rat went to keep under his bottomless hole. But he could not have picked up a nut to make a fire with as he had to work in the dark, and the rain was so thick it soon made the water so muddy that he could not tell what creatures were in it; and he did, of course, not like having to go about among such a lot of ugly things.\nBut in the black night, while he was sitting under the earth, there came a great clap of thunder and a shower of lightning. In the morning the rats found him under his hole with his head all wet and dripping. Seeing that he was taken ill, they watched him closely and saw that he died.\nThe rats soon began to talk about the strange weather; and one of them, who was clever and a bold one, sent down to the harbour to the Captain of the ship who was in command of the ship.\nWhen the Captain heard what had happened, \"Why, old chafer,\" said he, \"I must eat thee; and by the time thou art quite gone, so that thou canst not be missed, my vessel will be well supplied with her necessaries. Thou hast helped us in the rain, I verily believe, as well as saved our ship from sudden death. Let us feast and rejoice, for there is naught in the world to give thee up to except the water-rat.\" The Water-rat begged for mercy, and added that he was an old rat and had served many years. He was as good a rat as any, too; and had had all sorts of curious adventures. But the Captain laughed at him all the same, and told him outright, \"I do not want to be eaten, thank you; and besides, I have as much a dozen times already.\"\n\"But it would be but fair justice,\" said the Water-rat, \"for me to be paid for my trouble, for thou hast not told me how much thou wilt give me.\"\n\"I can afford to be generous,\" replied the Captain of the ship, \"and I will give thee what thou wants", "prompt": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole."}, {"id": 0, "gen_id": 3, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.

He looked about, and seeing that the way was clear for him to go up, he dived up a tree. He climbed up a little way, and looked down wondering what he was about to do. Here was a tree growing out of the ground, as big as a very large chair and as thick as a great book. Perhaps this tree was the last he would ever see. He looked more about, and was glad to see that his hole was still above ground. Still he climbed up a little way, and looked down again. When he came to that tree, one more climb would send him hanging down out of his hole; and he wanted to see what he was coming to. He put his nose against the tree-top: it was like soft moss. He looked lower, and presently he began to climb down the tree, stepping softly, and careful not to make a squeak. Presently he reached the foot of the tree, and looked and looked. Was he on safe ground? He knew if he jumped up again he would be hanging, one or both shoulders in the air. He stepped higher, and looked higher, till he was sure he was safe. Then he stepped down, and found he had nothing to do but to creep along the branch of his tree, till his hole did not look so far off. Soon he saw that he was outside again. He looked round, and saw the sun shining brightly, and the sky all clear and calm. The birds were singing, or rather peeping and crooning, up in the leaves. One of them, who was a great talker, said, \"Did you ever see the kind of tree that grows there?\" And off he went on his tale of the tree and the Water-rat. It looked to the Water-rat as if it had been an enchantment tree, a sort of magic tree, that gave to its owner whatever he asked for. Yes, he wanted to go into that tree, if he might! Yes, he would go up to the top, if he might! To get up he had to try if he could walk up and down on the moss, and he put on a little hop, and a little skip, and jumped from one twig to the next, till he found himself at the top. \"There's a nice seat,\" said the tree, \"and I won't mind if you sit down and rest yourself.\"\nWhen the old Water-rat saw the tree he thought to himself that it had to do with him somewhere, that he had some part in it, and that if it would not mind letting him climb onto its trunk and down upon its mossy branches it would be a wonder indeed if he didn't somehow manage to get something out of it that he wanted. So he called his wife and said, \"My dear wife.\" \"Is that you? I think you must be joking, Water-rat.\" \"I am neither joking nor laughing,\" replied the old Water-rat. \"There is enchantment in this tree; and whatever I ask, that I may not find that I have forgot some part of what I have to do, I should like you to climb up this tree.\" \"But what are you putting about?\" said the wife. \"Am I to climb for nothing?\" \"You are to climb for what I give you,\" answered the Water-rat. Then the wife got into the hole where her house was, and climbed up the tree. The moment she was within the tree's boundary she was changed into a dove. She spread out her wings, and she flew up and up and up over the green world, till she saw the sky and the snow, and all sorts of flowers and flowers and flowers. She flitted down, and fluttered over the water to where the Water-rat lived. \"I am come to ask you to climb up this tree,\" said the Water-rat. \"You are more to be pitied than I,\" replied the dove. \"I am what I am, and you are what you are, and I have lived my life in the heart's depths of the water, and you in the clouds. You are a man, and of the old Water-rat; if you could but make your mind up to do anything, you could make your back water or your wings grow like mine, but you can't do it. You must stay there.

The father and the mother were at home all the year round, because they were very lazy during the winter months.  They would have preferred to spend all their time in the house; but of course they would not, unless they were asked to supper, and they generally were. If they knew a little more about the world, they would very much prefer spending the winter at a watering-place, where there were plenty of pretty children to play with that they did not want on their plantation.\nTheir children would have understood their feelings much better than they did.  They were only stupid old ducks, like themselves, and as they would neither work nor learn, as many respectable people do at this moment, they ended by being given up, and given the whole afternoon off at a certain rate, in order to be put to sleep in an old rotten sheep-fold which they had purchased for a trifle.  If the father and mother had not been so lazy, and very disagreeable to be near, the little ones would certainly have understood their feelings in a much better way.

I know nothing about the feelings of parents,\u201d said the Water-rat; \u201cI am not a family man, and I have no idea of education.  But I can tell you, dear Duck, that having no children of my own, I cannot think it quite right to see them abused.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d replied the little Duck, \u201cbut how in the world are they to begin?  Our poor mother is too fat to stand on her head; and whenever she tries she shaks her head so that it does no good, and, besides, we can\u2019t all stand up at once.  I wish our tails were as long and as curly.\u201d\n\u201cYou are quite mistaken,\u201d said the little Water-rat, \u201ccurly tails are much more inconvenient than straight ones.  When you have to stick them out in a very windy day, and you know for certain that you can\u2019t hold them in, you have a most uncomfortable time about you.\u201d\n\u201cThen we shall not have curly tails then?\u201d cried the little Ducks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite see you don\u2019t,\u201d replied the Water-rat; \u201cit only lasts for a day, however long you run, the way you flap your whiskers about; and then your tail gets out of curl so stiffily that you can hardly budge it.\u201d\n\u201cO oh!\u201d cried the little Ducks, and they threw their little heads against the water in despair.  \u201cIf only we could get the Curly-Tail again, this dreadful weather would be a good deal better.\u201d\nHere their mother was standing on her head, shaking her head almost out of its gasket and keeping on with her lessons; for she knew that it would be useless to take such a chance with them at that age.  At last she thought she saw her little ones swimming about quite well, and she was just about to give them a little rest, when she caught sight of an old Frog coming along by the bank and making no attempt to keep out of her way.\n\u201cHullo! what are you doing here?\u201d she said in a polite kind of way; \u201cwill you come and sit here next to me, and if you like you may feed my little ones.\u201d\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d replied the old Frog; \u201cI should be ashamed to interfere in people\u2019s business.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be uneasy,\u201d said the old Duck, whom the Water-rat had mistaken for her mother; \u201cthey are quite at home here.\u201d\n\u201cI am getting quite at home myself, seeing how comfortable you are, I do not mind interfering in any thing,\u201d replied the Frog; \u201cevery creature has its rights, and I should be very much surprised if your children would never have curls.\u201d\n\u201cYou are always kind, my little friend,\u201d said the old Duck; \u201cand how in the world do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cSimple enough,\u201d answered the Frog; \u201cjust for a minute or two, while I am sitting here, my eyes fell upon your three little ones, and I didn\u2019t see one of them sporting with their tails.  If I were a father I would certainly be proud of my children, if I only knew that they had curly tails!\u201d\n\u201cYou are really very good, to speak like that,\u201d said their mother; \u201cbut all the same I am afraid my young ones will grow up as wild as those Frogs.

They looked just like real canaries of gold\u2014all gold, with real red legs.  They were so smart, too, and the little mother was as clever as a watch-dog\u2014never thought about herself, only she took such an interest in her little swans.\nBut the old Water-rat had other thoughts; he thought of the little water-rats and how clever they would be if they could only learn to stand on their heads in the water. Yes! the little water-rats were sure to succeed, even if they did not know it themselves.  That is just how little water-rats, with clean white heads and bright eyes, do succeed in teaching others how to stand on their heads in the water.\nThe little ducks were so happy that they could think of nothing else.  They were not worried by a thought of the future, or by any doubt as to how they were going to make their ways and live like the great folks in the palace.\nThe old Water-rat was as happy as the smallest duck and as clever as the cleverest of his daughters.  He loved to go down to his hole and just see how the little water-rats were progressing, and he would say to them:\n\u201cMy dear little creatures, I know you are all very clever and know how to swim, like real canaries.  Ah! what a comfort it will be to me to see you in the best society!\u201d\n\nIn due time the little water-rats learnt how to swim and how to be in the best society.  One would say that no ordinary little water-rat could have learnt all that quickly and the old Water-rat was only too willing to give his little scholars all the credit they deserved; but the little ducks said:\n\u201cThere is no doubt that this old Water-rat, as clever as he may be in his way, is very wrong when he says my little ducklings deserve to be drowned; my tiny little swans, who are such fine specimens of young beauty, have not done one little thing to deserve being drowned.\u201d\nThe little water-rats saw that the water-rat\u2019s wife had quite forgotten about them, and they began to long for society just like other little people. But they had worked hard, and when they were all in the best society no one was willing to grant the old Water-rat even a little credit for his cleverness in this matter.  So now he would have to go down into his hole and think while the little water-rats swam about in the pond.\n\u201cHow long you have been down here, old chap!\u201d cried one of the little water-rats, who was trying to learn how to stand on his head, when he saw his father coming up the river with the tiny birds in his mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is very nice of you to call me chum,\u201d answered the old Water-rat; \u201cit is much more likely that you will learn", "prompt": "</s>ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.

He took a long peep at the pond\u2019s bottom where there was no water, and above where it was not water, and then he walked down the bank on to the bank where there was water without any bottom.\nAll the little ducklings crowded round.\n\u201cI am sure it is all perfectly clear,\u201d said the old Water-rat; \u201cbut I can see nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThere it is,\u201d said the Duck, \u201cmore or less.\u201d\nAnd then the Water-rat took a long look at something which was not anywhere, and it was just as the Duck had said when she pointed it out to him.

The dear old father loved his children very dearly, but as an old uncle had told him that none of his family had ever lived to the age of seventy, and he himself only just reached the age of seventy-seven, he did not think it worth while to marry, and put them all in a great confusion.  The dear little children used to talk to him so about getting married in town that he got quite tired of it for a while, but the uncle, who lived in the same village, persuaded him to go to him, and there he got married.  Then there was a great deal of happiness, and the children all grew to man\u2019s estate, but when they had been a good deal, as old people do, all the children married one another, and the dear parents had no one to talk to but the babies, and then they became very silent and lonely. So one day the father and mother went and looked out over the waves, as they did every day, and saw a bright green island all shining all about like a sea of light; but when they got to it, they saw a stranger looking back at them with bright red eyes, who jumped into the water as soon as he spotted them.  He looked just like a big goldfish, or a large white trout, only he was much taller than either.  He sat upon his tail and looked at them, and said, \u2018Do you see me?  No wonder if you do not.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t you understand your own language?\u2019 said the father, who did not know any.\n\u201c\u2018You have no business speaking to me in my own language,\u2019 said this stranger; \u2018we are strangers from another world, and I came over to look at you. Don\u2019t you suppose it is interesting enough, as I am your only visitors, and they don\u2019t come often in the shape of men?\u2019\n\u201cAfter a time the stranger got up and looked out over the waves, and then spoke again: \u2018The little children cannot all come here, and there is something very sad in the idea of the parents feeling so solitary", "prompt": "</s>ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.

So he had to keep himself shut up in his palace, and then the people took it for granted that he would do nothing but play all day.  It is such a pleasant thing to sit round a good fire and eat sweetmeats, and be well rested after a good night\u2019s sleep!  This happened every day to the King, and he did not seem to care at all about anything else.\n\u201cAt length news came to him that great enemies were at his gate--enemies, I may remark, who were quite ready for any sort of a fight, because the King did not take any interest in anything on earth.  These enemies were called the Red-backs; and when all the King\u2019s men could not drive them off, the King cried,\n\u201c\u2018Oh! my faithful Red-back supporters!  Why are you so easily moved?  When the Black-winged Hawks and the Yellow-billed Robins had set themselves up against me, why didn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u201cThen there was a great cry, \u2018Because we feared to stir up your passion.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018No, no, my friends--and perhaps you were right.  I have plenty of passion enough without encouraging you.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Our duty lay elsewhere.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Then what shall we do?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know what course to take.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018The Red-backs will at once make you aware of it.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSo they at once did.  The King was so much excited that he could not tell what to do himself, and his enemies could not have been a few birds, for all the people did so little to help him.

They brought him in after a long time, and for four days I heard nobody in the village talk about them except about what their poor father would do now that he had lost two of his children.

But the old ducks said they wouldn\u2019t have heeded his growth much, for boys\u2019 bodies grow pale even when they are quite young, when they haven\u2019t had enough to eat.

He told his mother that the Water-rat was not worth listening to and that she ought to mind her own business.  Then he got up very early the next morning, dressed himself with great care, put on a smart hat, and went out into the street.  Two hours later he found himself installed at the head of a table in a pretty little parlour which was full of old flowers, green herbs, and little birds.  Two of these had nestled up on the topmost leaves of the table, where their wings were carefully folded, and their eyes hidden behind little green felt-covered slits.  They were sound asleep.\nPresently their brother and sister came down for breakfast.  In answer to the Linnet\u2019s question they explained that they had taken rooms in the house near the water-way.  \u201cWe have always been fond of going there,\u201d they said; \u201cit is so quiet and cool in the early morning.

He never meant to leave the world, but of late years he had been keeping such strange hours, and only got into the habit of leaving his hole at night after dark.  He was glad that the two young ducks were there and his sister; but they were only pretty pictures, whereas their brother and sister were real living creatures.  Besides, he would have liked to have seen their mother in person.  At length he managed to say that he had decided to follow his brother--his first instinct being to keep company with his own family.  But his brother declined to have any more to do with him; so the Water-rat had to drag his own sister along, and the old Rat had to follow the other two.  All the time he was saying to himself--\n\u201cWhat a fool I am to leave my hole!

A gardener planted an apple-tree on his property, and the fruits of the tree began to fall.  The gardener came home one afternoon and found the tree still full of apples, and one would think that the tree would never wear out.  So he put into the ground two long spikes of corn, to keep off the prying little beggars; but that did not prevent them from breaking down his hedges and pulling his chickens from under his feet.  One day his wife wanted to look out of the window at the beautiful apple-tree, but she saw nothing but a mass of ugly black branches and empty apples.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the gardener?\u201d asked the Water-rat.\n\u201cOh, you might think he was dying.\u201d\n\u201cDid you ever hear the like?\u201d cried the Water-rat.\n\u201cThe gardener had every reason to feel very badly indeed,\u201d replied the Linnet.  \u201cHe could not stop for ever, and he looked as he had nothing to live for. He was miserable and vexed, and felt that there was nothing for it but to take his own life.  Then a little thought crossed his mind, and he thought: \u2018Well, if I die you will not be able to get the apples, and I will have a friend.\u2019  So he made up his mind never to marry, and to live as long as he possibly could.  He said to himself, \u2018I am not going to marry until I find a good, true friend.\u2019  He lived as long as he could, but the apples still fell.  One day he found that he could not go on for ever without something to live for; so, with a deep sigh, he took his own life.  But he had been kind to a hedgehog who lived in a hole on his premises, and in his last moments he gave the hedgehog the best apples he had--it was very kind of him!\u201d\n\u201cHow queer little creatures they are!\u201d cried the Water-rat.  \u201cI should never have supposed that hedgies had any feelings.\u201d\nThe little bird flapped his wings and gave a friendly blow to the old Water-rat, who was swimming along with his mouth wide open.", "prompt": "</s>ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.

Their names were: Peony, Jack, Jerry, Alice, Tommy, Daisy, Dolly, Peter, and Henry; and the children used to pretend that nothing was further from their minds than going into Mrs. Giant\u2019s garden: but they would always go in and watch the Giant for half an hour.\n\nThey used to sit round behind his arbour at the foot of the garden, or at the top of the steps, where there were always some flowers on the walls. It has a great gate leading up to it, with a lock, and another one at the back, to keep out the pigs.\n\nThe Giant was very powerful and stout, and when he came out at the height of the day, and every one was quite accustomed to him, his body seemed just as big as a whale, and his head larger.\n\nThe children had a great time in getting to know him. Every one used to say that he had a very dull face, for he only looked at his work and never spoke; and those who looked at him more carefully found that the ground upon which he walked felt soft underneath him, and that a hollow grew beneath him, but it always made a noise the longer he went on his way.\n\nThe children used to laugh at all these stories, and often hearken for his steps; and when they heard them coming, and knew them and feared them, they used to all go nearer together to watch what he was doing. Sometimes they would see him take hold of some one by a leg, and carry them away as if they were nothing at all.\n\nOne child was carried away by him, and another was taken away by a pig. After that the children used to go and sit by the Giant, and watch him work, and be taken to the farm, and do all sorts of odd jobs, but always he was always polite, and gave them cake and something sweet; and if any one was ill he would come and see him, and take the children home with him for his amusement. But the children always suspected a trick in everything he did.\n\nThe Giant and the pig went about the different parts of the farm, turning the wheels and throwing the peas through the threshing machine. The pease kept sticking together so that when they were carried away to the market every one laughed at them.\n\nThe children used to watch them, and pretend they would work a long time and never stop, but, in reality, they were not doing anything at all; for although he pretended to grind the peas, he never paid attention to them at all.\n\nHe turned all the people\u2019s work over and over; he kept the pigs and horses turned round and round as long as they would go, which was till they died, because they were no good for anything else.\n\nWhen he was quite tired of his work, he used to open the gateway at the top, and see all the people in the fields again, and look down on them; and the children watched him from the bottom of the great gate at the foot of the garden, and thought he was very wicked and cruel.\n\nBut when they turned the pease over, they found at the bottom they were all clean. He always said, \u201cLet us have a great feast,\u201d and so, when he had worked about two hours, they had a great feast.\n\nThe Giant used to have a good many pigs, and he never looked very fond of any of them, but he liked to own that it was he that fed them. He would put his hand in his pocket, and look at all his money; he never gave any of it to the pigs but he would give them a mouthful from his bread and butter. They used to like that very much.\n\nWhen they were eating it, it would soon disappear; so, if any one had a piece of money he would steal it; and, when the poor woman had nothing left, the Giant used to go and steal from her; but he always came back with some bread and butter.\n\nOne of the worst things he did, was that one day he went to a cottage and murdered a man and a nurse in it. When he had done this, he picked up the body, because nobody knew he had done it, and set it up by the side of the window looking very pleasant. In the daytime he always had some flowers about him. When the people came to the cottage, the nurse had put out a table, and was cooking some tea, when the Giant, who was walking by, saw the kettle boiling and came to eat some.\n\nThe child looked out of the window, and said, \u201cNaughty!\u201d but the nurse did not hear, and when she was coming back from where she was playing", "prompt": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden."}, {"id": 1, "gen_id": 1, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden.\n\nBut one rainy afternoon, just as they were about to start, a tall, dark-haired man in a tall, dark-eyed woman\u2019s overcoat came up to the gate.

In the afternoon she took the bundle up the garden and put it in the garden house, where the children played with it all the afternoon. She came out in the evening and opened the door.\n\nIt made a very good hiding place, and it was very warm inside. It was a very comfy bed. The Mother called the children, and they heard the door open and close, and a voice say, \u201cOh what a nice warm bed.\u201d And next morning when they came out of school they found the bundle lying on the floor of the garden, with a little note in it. It said, \u201cCome and see me to-morrow, so I can give you your own bundle back.\u201d\n\nTHE GIRL IS FOUND CRYING\n\nSo she was very careful about locking the door at night, and when the children were asleep she took the bundle and hid it in the ground at the side of the rosebushes, where it was quite hidden.\n\nAnd on the next day she went to the Giant\u2019s place. When she got to the end of the road and saw the house, she heard a voice say to her:\n\n\u201cPlease, would you go inside and tell the Giant\u2019s mother that I have sent my boy to come for my child.\u201d\n\nSo the girl went in, and as soon as she had got inside she said: \u201cI am coming away with him for good. The little boy will be happier here than he could ever be at home, and I am going to take him and take him far, and when he wants to come back, we will come back together.\u201d\n\nAND THE BUNDLE IS GIVE BACK\n\n\u201cIf you had your own child you could have done the same,\u201d said the Mother.\n\nAnd the Giant said, \u201cPerhaps more, for you have a little girl who is wonderful.\u201d\n\nAnd he fetched the little girl and showed her the bundle, and took her away with him for a while. And when she had seen everything there was to see, and felt lonely for her mother, he took her back and gave her back her bundle with a letter in it.

For many years it had been known as \u201cthe Little Giant\u2019s,\u201d but in 1891, in consequence of growing crowds and congestion of people in the streets outside the place, it was resolved to destroy the Gardens and build a new one.\n\nThe plan was to enlarge the grounds of the Royal Military College, and the builders were engaged to occupy them with a number of pavilions and other buildings for public use, while the Giant\u2019s house itself was to be pulled down to make room for the extension.\n\nThe plan was not an unpopular one, and the people were of one mind in the selection of their representative in the matter \u2013 the Giant. He was in the full pomp of his manhood and quite undaunted by the prospect of change.\n\nHe lived as in olden days under his house and the garden of trees, content and free to indulge in the exercise he loved best; it is said that the last time he was seen by the public was in 1874,\n\nBut in the excitement of the demolition work he was found at work one day, his spade in one hand and his hatchet in the other, making an improvised barricade of trees in the form of a square, which of course was destroyed without hesitation. He retired then, and for a number of years no one even dreamed that he was still alive.\n\nAlthough it was generally understood that his burial ground was in an old garden patch opposite the station, no one paid any attention to the fact.

Once the gardener had seen them there, he would give them each a bundle of firewood to cut for him. Every afternoon for six or seven days the children worked in the Giant\u2019s garden. He very generously gave them as much wood as they wanted. He gave them the wood because of a promise he had made to the little Boy.\n\nOnce the Boy had made a large bonfire. He was very proud of it because it was his greatest masterpiece. In the middle of the fire there was a big apple. And a little further up the fire there was another apple. And then every time the Boy threw in a stick of wood something else would happen. These same things repeated themselves in the garden, in every place the Boy threw in a stick of wood.\n\nWell, at last the Boy had burnt up the first stick of wood. The Giant came in to see if he had done a good job. But the Boy had nearly burnt the whole garden a couple of times. The Giant told him: But I\u2019ve got something made of water for you, every time you throw in a stick of wood. Do come and see it! The Boy went to the garden to see the Giant\u2019s wonderful invention. Only a big hole in the ground would be left when the stick of wood was burnt.\n\nWhen the Boy had looked all over the garden he looked longer at the water. The water was so beautiful that it made him forget all about the water by the first fire. He took out a stick of wood and threw it into the water. And the water began to dance round him. And more and more, till something far bigger than he ever had before was shaking him and wiggling him and playing games with him. It was a very strange feeling for him. When the Boy looked into the water he saw the little Boy.\n\nThen came the real surprise. The little boy said: I saw something on the bank the other evening. You are going to take me to see it. Well, the Giant was very very pleased about his invention. First he took the Boy down to the river bank. And when they got there, there was the little boy and the little Giant. The Boy had a lovely picnic picnic. And the little boy turned back into the wood. And when he came back he turned into the Big Red Giant again.\n\nThe first time he came out of the water the Great Red Giant said: And if I\u2019ve done it properly this time, you will be able to play with me all the time. And you won\u2019t have to go out after me; I\u2019ll be coming to you all the time. And then they had a very pleasant evening together. Meanwhile, all the time the Old Giant had been running about the village looking for his water-rat. It is very sad for the Great Red Giant when the Old Giant forgets that the Little Boy has got into the water. But he knows at once that he has got to find him or the Little Giants will have him in a terrible way. He doesn\u2019t ask where the little boy has gone; he just has to guess.

But when the Giant said: \u201cI am hungry,\u201d the door opened and the beautiful little lady disappeared, and the Giant could hear her beating a small drum.  He ran after her and asked: \u201cWhy did you disappear?  Why did you frighten me last night?\u201d\nBut the drum-beating lady answered: \u201cI did not make anyone afraid.

He seized the King by his beard and scratched him.  The King was so annoyed that he thought of some means of injuring the Giant.  Quickly he picked up a club and struck him on the head.  That frightened the Giant away, but he did not go immediately. He looked round, and seeing a window in the wall, he climbed up and dropped to the floor below.  Then he saw a tall bedstead with a large bed in it.  Quickly he slid on to it and made a meal of the King.  After eating as much as he wanted he went.\n\u201cWhy did you not go the first time,\u201d asked the King.\n\u201cBecause the second time I was ill,\u201d replied the Giant, very quietly; and the King wondered how he could have been ill, for there was nothing he wanted.\nOne evening the same thing happened, only when he was coming down the window he sat down on the floor.  The King said: \u201cI am glad that you died the last time, for then I was robbed of a great deal of corn.\u201d The Giant then disappeared through the window and this time it really was quite impossible to find him.\n\u201cThat was dreadful,\u201d thought the King, \u201cHe must die, that\u2019s quite clear.

So the Sun let the Giant go back once more.\n\nBut last year, when the leaves were growing on the trees, the Giant flew away again, for he had not been able to go home till Christmas.  He had gone to fetch the goose that had laid golden eggs, but, when he came back, the goose had been gone, in a hurry to go to her own home.  When the Giant came back all the trees had been stripped of their leaves, in order to have firewood for the houses.  He would get no firewood, but he had enough fuel for himself, for he baked a great many cakes.  When he came back he went into the garden and looked for his children, but they could not be found.

And where does he and his garden lie?\u201d\n\u201cThe Giant, as you see, is a very old man, and all he and his garden are of one stone.  The Giant\u2019s house is over there against the hill, and there are stairs and steps; at the top there is a door, and behind the door lies his garden.  When the Giant came to look for his garden, he found, instead of beautiful flowers, an old man and a small stone house.  The old man told him all that he had done, but the Giant could not understand, and when he saw the stone house he was angry, for he always thought if he had to be buried alive he must be buried in the midst of beautiful gardens.  So the Giant looked harder and harder at the old man, and before the morning had come he had got him at his mercy.  He took him and put him into the chest which I am holding in my hand, and carried him away into the house where the King\u2019s son lay sick with the pox.

When he had taken his breakfast he went out over the white tower, which is behind the house which I was telling you about, and a great stone stopped his way, and he had to turn back.

You had better not laugh at me.\u201d\nThen the giants had an interview with the King, and he sent for the Giant.  The Giant came into the court, all black and grim, and before the King he told all the adventures of the seven years.  The King was very glad to hear the story, and when he went away he sent four of the giants to fetch the little girl.  When the servants appeared with the child the Princess was terrified.  \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she cried, \u201cto be accused of a crime after having done so little?\u201d  The servants told her the story, and she began to think of how she would break out of her prison; but the moment she looked at the Giant\u2019s little finger she was caught and thrown into his closet, and there she was left.\nThe Princess spent the rest of the day in asking for help.  It was impossible for her to do this without crying, for her tears would not let her see through a hole, but she took to throwing pebbles through the opening in the ceiling in order to break those peals which fell upon her.  By this diversion she made her lips and teeth so thin that she could not speak very well.  She became so weak that she had to crawl about, and if she stayed in one place too long she would get tired.  At last, at the end of a week, the Giant let the little girl out and told her to go through the gate.\nAll went very quiet at the palace since the disappearance of the Princess, but no one had any doubt but that he would soon pay for her crime.  He had to wait three months, however, but his impatience at the stillness was greater than his cruelty.  Besides, he had to keep a strict look-out at his garden, and since nothing could be seen, he had no excuse for coming out to see it.\nOne day he came very late.  As he came out he saw the Princess crawling through the hedge.  He caught her at once and carried her into her closet.  Now he had no idea what to do with her, for no one had ever treated his children as he was doing hers; she was a captive, and if he knew how to treat a captive his life would only be made more horrible.\nFor five days he kept her in the closet without letting her see a single ray of sunshine, and her mouth was so thin that she could not speak a word.  She had not given up her attempts to break out, and she often crawled up the wall in order to make her voice heard above the continual din of the Peasants.  At last, however, she became too weak to crawl.  The Giant thought that when she was well enough she would tell a useful tale, and perhaps so it was that he brought her, one fine day, to the King.\n\nSTORY II--THE BRAVE BROTHER\n\nCHAPTER I.--THE BRAVE BROTHER\nThe King was sitting in his palace, waiting to hear what the Princess would say to him.  When the Giant was finished his story he said: \u201cPrincess, the Giant of Cornwall is a good man.  He has treated you very nicely.  Therefore you must not be angry with him.  He was a man himself before he became a giant, and has never done anything that he did not think right.  Therefore, he would be glad to have you marry one of his sisters.\u201d\n\u201cI will not marry any of his sisters,\u201d said the Princess.  \u201cIf I were to marry any of them before the sentence of death should have", "prompt": "</s>EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden.\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.

They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  \u201cHow happy we were there,\u201d they said to each other.\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it closed its beautiful eyes for a moment and never opened them again.\nSoon the little children began to feel very miserable.  They tried to talk about the garden to other people, but nobody heard them.  At last it seemed as though they must be starved to death, for they had no food at all.  They were too kind and good, even in the Land of the Selfish Giant, to steal or to harm anything.  So they cried and moaned as though a big dog had come to carry them off.\nTo all appearances the Giant did not care two straws for his children, but he thought he had a very good excuse for the notice-board.  Each stone of it was worth something, he thought, and it was the only road to his castle.  He wished that there was nobody to pass the stone through the notice-board--that nobody could see it--and this made him very angry.\nHe could not help it if anybody saw a notice-board.  Now all the people and animals knew where he lived, and he was being punished for being selfish.  He had no friends any more, and the children had no food any more.  Day by day he grew more unhappy, and he determined to have another notice-board.\nHe went to the shopkeeper, and bought a fine notice-board made of red wood with big golden studs.  This he carried back with him to the wall, and the children who came to play under it soon found it out.\nThey went and opened it at night, for when they reached their home at night time their father would often tell them stories, and they were always pleased to see him.  Just as they entered the castle, their father took the notice-board away and put it in the hall.\nThis time it was found by some passing mice that it was hollow, so they went in and slept there, and made the garden of the Selfish Giant a great hotel for mice.  The children complained to their father about the holes, but he would not say anything.\nOne morning when everyone was up, the boys went into the garden one by one, first locking the gate behind them, and taking with them a pot of warm water and a clean cloth.

Then they all went to work at once.  First we will tell you what they did.\nOne boy sharpened his spade, and another his rake.  A third boy threw a heap of stones into a long hole which the Giant had dug for a mill-wheel.  Another boy set fire to one of the peaches, and the fire ran up the wall, killing it.\nIt was a very long time before the Giant\u2019s garden became quite beautiful; but at last it was all alive, and the children were so glad.

So they went that day into the garden, and cut down the two largest trees.  As the stone wall rose higher and higher they said that what was left of the peaches in the tree-tops was enough for the children.

At last she visited Quail's, and found him sitting in the nest,\nnot unlike the elder she had looked down upon in her young days.\n\nQuail looked at the Duck, but she looked at him very earnestly and\nasked: \"Do you think you could take any one, Quail, because you would\nwant to go?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" replied Quail, \"for I think that anyone, even a\nFather-Bird, would be difficult to manage.\"\n\nHowever, he was glad to get counsel, and thanked the Duck for her guidance.\n\nTo his great surprise and delight, however, he found he was very\nable to get on with his father.\n\nThat night Quail went home with the Duck, and lived in the big home\nher children had been building for her, under her care.\n\nThe family now became very great, for everybody went away to foreign\ncountries, and their mother was not seen except at times, because she\nhad to build the nest once in a while.\n\nThe young Birds went to all the foreign countries, first learning\nto fly, and then to marry.

I will get up for a walk.\"\n\nThey all began to follow him about and to take care of him. But in\na few hours he had caught cold, and was laid in the deep-green grass\nby the shores of the lake. There he lay for two days and nights,\nand then he begged to be carried. They laid him down by the edge of\nthe water, and carried him to the large green trees, and placed him up\namong the branches. Then they gathered thick leaves and grass around\nhim, for that is all the sick Duck wants; and the Mother Duck brought\na little stick for her little heir to gnaw on. When he would lie\nstill with his face full of leaves, the Mother Duck herself laid on\nhis back, so that he could not get too hot. In two days the weather\nbecame warm, and in three days he became well enough to stand upright.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Mother Duck, \"we will begin our journey again.\"\n\nSo the twelve Ducks took an early train of steps, and were soon at the\nnearest water.

You shall not know its genuineness, nor its origin: but I will guard it with my life, as well as the life of my rose.\u201d\nTo this proposition the beautiful creature smiled, and bowed her gratitude; but I can only add, that her eyes were kindled with a gentle fire, more ardent than the red one of the rose, and that her manner was far from cold.\n\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\nA MESSAGE FROM NEARBY.\n\u201cWhat a bold proceeding to send this girl a rose!\u201d said the good old Reverend Mother, who, at the outset of my narrative, had taken up my case with warm interest, and who continued to follow me with close observance and some sympathy, as a nurse follows ailing child, hoping to cure it.  \u201cI agree with you that Rosa can not possibly be the daughter of that old man.  She must be the mistress of some rich man; and it is quite surprising that a rich man should have a poor daughter like that.  But for the strange colour of her hair, I might believe there could not be a more amiable-looking young woman, excepting Rose.\u201d\n\u201cYou should not praise Rose in that manner!\u201d said the Student. \u201cIt is true, madam, we have never seen her at the family table, until to-day, when she escorted me for a time in search of the rose.  I must acknowledge, however, that she showed, to a certain degree, the ladyly deportment befitting a lady accustomed to serve her mistress with fine ease.  If this can be a fitting term for the genteel appearance and behaviour of a rose-girl.  I will not try to describe her beauty, madam, for you already have a true painter\u2019s eye for the most amiable qualities.  Our eyes are naturally incapable of discerning certain charms that require an extra quantity of the best judgment to discover.  Still, I will endeavour to give you an outline sketch of Rosa.  Being of a singularly robust constitution, and possessing an appearance of health and cheerfulness which is not common, Rose has already completed fifteen years of age: and I must add, that her beauty, by having the complexion of a rose, is peculiarly engaging.\u201d\n\nNow, I cannot claim such extreme good fortune in the composition of my little romance as is ascribed by the Student in this character-recollecting sketch.  I assure you, my dear Mary, that it is the least original story that ever was written.  I always carry it in my mind, that the Rose of the Student was intended, by some mysterious agency, as my special subject of study, in order that my faculties of description might be tested at the expense of that delicious flower.  Thus, I found myself almost every day in the neighbourhood, in order to gaze upon Rosa as she danced or drove past.  And there can be no doubt, as my reader will readily judge, that I took the opportunity to study her beauties, and to compare her qualities and graces; in order to become familiar with her, in order that we should have as near a knowledge of each other, if and when I succeeded in forming a plan of action which would involve her in my arms, as it did many, many others besides myself.  It may be asked whether I did not take advantage of the opportunity, and make advances to Rosa.  With what feelings did I enter into that conversation about the rose, which I narrate below, if you please to ask.  I had reason to believe, that I should not, for some time yet, find myself in a condition to take vows; and I did not desire to leave the School with less than three friends of my own.  So the first moment of opportunity arrived (and you have already guessed its mysterious character), when I might convey a few tokens of a more permanent kind of affection; which were more likely to make Rose, than others, acquainted with them, and thereby to give her some intimation, that it was a serious intention on my part to try and acquire her affections. I immediately obtained permission from my superiors to visit the garden, in order to make certain arrangements, relative to Rosa in her father\u2019s immediate neighbourhood, where she might be in the habit of associating; in order to ascertain what sort of family life was led under", "prompt": "\u201cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\u201d cried the young Student; \u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose."}, {"id": 3, "gen_id": 4, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "\u201cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\u201d cried the young Student; \u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose.\u201d So saying, he rushed from this world and out of her memory into a world where there are roses, and danced merrily with them up and down the hall of the dead. When she spoke once more in that world, the dear ones that were there cried aloud, \u201cO, come with us to the fields of flowers!\u201d But this time they refused, and said, \u201cShe is still young and has a life before her; we are old and have no share in life but what is past.\u201d And so they were, but that was no reason why she should not have red roses in her garden, both her heart and the world and the flowers on them seemed to say. But she and the Student and the dear ones that were there were the only ones at the end, and some were bitter with sorrow and weariness, while others were full of hope. And they had to go, for the door opened; there was nothing to do but say good-by. They said: \u201cGood-by, and do not let us be separated any longer. Behold, the door opens. Come in!\u201d And she and the young Student came in; and the door shut, and it was still. They could only hear the wails of the poor ones that were bitter with sorrow and weariness and the sweet songs of the flowers and the singing of the birds. And she and the young Student went up and down the hall of the dead. Sometimes when she approached the world where the young Student danced at her bidding, she could not turn from it, though it was the garden-wall\u2014a dreadful world in some ways\u2014fain would she turn from it, and could only exclaim, \u201cCome, sweet soul, come, come!\u201d And he smiled and danced up and down before her, and she, holding him in her arms, stood quite still with the words flying through her mind, \u201cCome, dear soul, come, come, come!\u201d and he answered: \u201cIt is not for me to come, but for thee to come.\u201d So she went on from one garden into another and he still danced before her, and they stood quite still. That evening she was at home, and said to her mother, \u201cWe went to the garden of Death to-day and the hall of the dead, and while we were standing there, there came a light and a voice told us: \u2018We cannot keep her any longer, for she will be turned out of the world to-morrow morning.

Then was the Prince\u2019s hand held out to him, and it was as if a great cord had been coiled about his fingers, which touched only the tips of the tips between the Lady of the Pool\u2019s feet.\n\u201cWe have danced together,\u201d he said; \u201cwe have clasped hands as we have passed the Lady of the Pool together, but now kiss me and bless me.\u201d\nHe kissed her and she blessed him; and then they danced, and they held hands, and when the ball was over, and they had run swiftly through the gardens, the Prince kissed her again and she rose and thanked him and kissed his lips, and thanked him, and kissed him, and they ran swiftly through the gardens, and again the Prince kissed the Lady of the Pool; and again the Lady rose and thanked him, and they kissed each other, and thanked each other, and went back to their garden.\nAnd now after this it behoved them to wed, but the Lady of the Pool was rich and went to Italy every year, while the Student remained behind, and he knew that he was to become a scholar and would walk by the lakes.\nThen she came at last to him:\n\u201cWhy do you remain in the garden?\u201d said she.\n\u201cWhy have you come?\u201d said he.\n\u201cWhy have you loved me?\u201d said she.\n\u201cWhy have you loved me?\u201d he replied.\n\u201cAt last, I have found you,\u201d she cried, and laughed and kissed him, and he thought she laughed from joy.\nAfter that he saw her no more, but he knew that if she went to Italy he was to be a scholar, and he loved her, and he remembered the words which she had spoken to him in the pool, the night before the ball, the words which he had not understood then, because he could not grasp the truth until it was spoken of him in his old age.\nAnd this is where the story ends.\nAnd so the Student of the Moon who would be a lover was made a scholar, and when he saw her he thought her poor, and after that he thought her a witch, for", "prompt": "</s>\u201cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\u201d cried the young Student; \u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose.\u201d\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\u201cNo red rose in all my garden!\u201d he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.  \u201cAh, on what little things does happiness depend!

Then he went back again to his study, for his mother had sent him back that he might take part in her ball.  All day he toiled over his course of study, when at last night came, and over the hill rode the Student\u2019s handsome grey steed.\nIn a little cave stood a grey stone, and by the cave sat the old keeper of the gate, waiting till the travellers arrived on the coast.  They came galloping over the hill, singing and laughing, and they passed through the gate into the King\u2019s garden.  And the King beheld the lovely fair one, and he came to the King\u2019s palace as he passed, for he knew not his true country, and he went to the Queen\u2019s palace when he came to his own.\n\u201cWho is it that seeks my daughter\u2019s love?\u201d cried the King.\n\u201cMy lady\u2019s student, O King,\u201d replied the student.  \u201cI came to you, for I cannot cross the sea to the far East.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d said the King, \u201che brings red roses, and the fair one loves him; well and good; let him come.\u201d\nAs he passed before his palace he saw a young maiden standing in a flower-garden.  She looked at the beautiful city of the King, and at the towers of the palace in the West, which her lover had made when he lay in his prison; and she said to herself, \u201cOh, the young lord who has so given his heart to me has brought his horse to a flower-garden.  For him must I now toil!\u201d\nBut when the green and golden towers were near, and the great sea was at her feet, she came rushing to the sea-shore, and laid her hands upon the beautiful horse, and laughed as she raised her cheek to his mane.\nWith that came her true lover, and he seized the student by his arm, and carried him into a field, and they laid them upon the grassy sward.\n\u201cNow, fair lover,\u201d said the Student, \u201ctell me, whence have you come?\u201d\n\u201cFrom a dark and distant East were I brought hither,\u201d answered the other.\n\u201cAnd what wert thou doing there?\u201d\n\u201cWeep! weep! thou must weep, for I have lost my way.\u201d\nThen the Student wept, for in memory of his dear country, for the maiden who had rescued him.

They passed through them swiftly, over the stones covered with bright colours that shone in the bright morning light.  They hurried past the open gate, and up a long graveled path.  The sun played on the red sails which billowed overhead; far out across the waters they could see the green hills of the land beyond, the dim blue mountains, and a deep blue sea dappled with green waves.  The earth, the air, the whole wide world grew radiant, and Chameleon felt that every breath that he drew was full of poetry and of music.  The city whirled round him; flowers and fruit and fruit-trees flashed and glitters; all wore golden raiment, and the streets were strewn with bright flowers.\nJust by the gates they found the Queen, leading out Beauty.  Beauty had on a robe of purple satin round which flashed golden roses, and one arm slipped through her robes was wreathed with live-roses; her foot stood on a golden footstool, and next to her sat a courtier who held in his hand a golden fan.  His face was hidden from Chameleon by the fan, but Beauty was smiling when they saw her.\nBy the Queen they heard a jingling of golden trappings.  They turned; the King and Queen passed past them quickly, not raising their eyes to look at them, but passing them in silence.  On ahead they saw several men mounted on very high horses, their steeds showing beneath the richly-loved coats, their bells tinkling in the air as they leapt forward.

In his massive, bronze hands he clutched his favorite toy. A little boy, hidden from view by a tree-branch, gazed down at him.The little boy's name was Kiki. He loved the Happy Prince.\n\nAt night he lay in bed with the window open, staring at the Happy Prince, who gazed back at him.\n\n\"You are my true friend,\" Kiki told him, \"my special friend.\" He was very sure of the Happy Prince's goodness and understanding, and every night he waited for him to come down the hill from where he lived with his parents. But at night he dreamed that the Happy Prince was lonely and cried and wished that he could go with him on his travels.\n\nEvery morning Kiki went out and gave cheerfully and lovingly to those who needed help. Before long, Kiki found out that he was quite good at sweeping and carrying water. He became just as fond of these things as of the happy prince.\n\nOne morning, however, the Queen of the Happy Prince came riding over the hill. She dismounted and climbed the tall column. She leaned over and looked down on Kiki.\n\n\"You must not walk around this column waving your hands about!\" she said sternly. \"This column is very heavy and would fall over on you if you were to climb on top of it.\"\n\nKiki bowed his head in apology.\n\n\"Now go,\" the Queen of the Happy Prince said, \"and play with your other friends on the grass; but you must not use your special wand any more.\"\n\n\"But I love my wand,\" Kiki begged.\n\n\"Never mind your wand now,\" the Queen said. \"Follow that little boy who goes on his way. Ask him if you can help him.\"\n\n\"And I do very much wish to help him,\" called Kiki down to the other little boy, who turned and looked up at him.\n\n\"Will you follow me?\" he said. \"If so, you may use any magic you please.\"\n\n\"I will follow you,\" Kiki agreed, and away they went to a quiet spot where they were alone in a hollow in the hills.\n\n\"You see,\" said the little boy, \"we are going into a little kingdom, where everything is bright and beautiful, and there are no such things as storms. We are going to plant some trees and to build a church.\"\n\n\"Isn't it a beautiful kingdom?\" Kiki was looking around him with wide, childlike eyes.\n\n\"It certainly is,\" said the little boy. \"We have built a stone house for our Prince, so that he may dwell in peace and comfort; and we have taken away one king and given him to the clouds, and so we are now the one and only King, and we are very glad.\"\n\n\"What is it, little boy?\" Kiki asked.\n\n\"I want you to go into one of the clouds and tell them that the Happy Prince wants to come to our little kingdom.\"\n\n\"What will happen if the clouds refuse to let the Happy Prince in?\" Kiki asked.\n\n\"Then the clouds will become very sick and unhappy and want to die, and we shall have to pay a heavy penalty,\" the little boy replied.\n\nKiki shivered at the thought of this. Clouds being so unhappy seemed to him to be so like the terrible thing that happened every night, when the Happy Prince was growing sad and crying.\n\n\"What price shall I have to pay to get the clouds to let the Prince in?\" Kiki asked.\n\n\"Only a wooden broom,\" said the little boy; \"and it is so simple that it will not cost you any trouble at all.\"\n\nSo Kiki picked up the happy prince's wand and went into the clouds.\n\nAt first he could hardly bear the wind and the cold; and then, as the wind tousled his brown hair, he said to the clouds:\n\n\"I am a poor little boy. I am tired, and I am cold. It seems to me that a very ugly and heavy rain has come into my wind to-night because the clouds are very unhappy.

He was tall and he was broad, and his clothes were always of a golden hue. For he loved gold, and it came, like rain, to water his fields: and the very birds brought him their fruit, and the flowers themselves loved him when he spoke to them. And the Happy Prince, though he was great and good, yet he was not a wise man: he was only kind and merry, though he knew that there was mischief in the world. When he wanted to pass a day in quiet meditation, he climbed up the column, and built himself a little house out of the woodpecker's teeth, which had fallen to the ground; and there, taking a seat on the topmost rung, he turned his face upward to look at the world, for the birds loved him still, and the flowers wanted to grow and be seen by him. All the people loved him, and the deer came and bowed to him when he passed them: and the little white cat, who had come with him from the palace, wished every day to climb up and make himself at home under his arm.\nThere was a great man who loved to study, and who had lived many ages before the Happy Prince, and he had many books that he read, and he knew many things, and was very wise; and yet he felt that it was not enough to know all wisdom, and all the wonderful things that were done in the world, for some one should be happy also, and all the world should have rest and peace. He therefore climbed up to the top of a dark hollow tree, and let his hand fall on the Happy Prince's golden head, for he loved him; and he called to him by name, and he cried, or sometimes he wept, or sometimes he laughed; but his answers were always sweet and soft, and the Happy Prince loved him still, and talked with him about all the events in the world. It was a cold winter evening that they were talking together, for the Happy Prince had gone up to the top of the dark hollow tree that day to hide away from winter; and he sat alone in the snow, making a little room for the Happy Prince in the hollow trunk.\nBut there was nothing that the Happy Prince cared about so much as the wonderful things in the world. He wished to know everything and to hear of everything; and so he and the great man talked on until late into the night. And when daylight awoke, the Happy Prince wanted to go home, for he had a little white cat to take care of; and he called to the great man, who was asleep in the tree, and said: \"Please let me climb down with you, for I am so cold that I must go home early; and please let me sleep in your home, for your bookcase is so full of wonders that I shall never know all the facts.\" The great man then dressed himself and helped the Happy Prince down the tree; but they both had such deep colds that they could not move.\nThe next morning they fell in behind the Happy Prince as he went in a great procession to the court of a great king. As they came up the shining, snow-covered road, the king's servants saluted him with great solemnity, and they bowed down before him, a hundred thousand men and women in their great bright gowns. But the Happy Prince answered them by shouting and laughing and blowing his nose all in a hurry.\n\"Oh, king,\" said he, \"what folly is this to bow down to that old, long-haired idiot? Is it only from politeness, or because I have been good-natured? I am not such an easy fool.\"\n\"The Lord Almighty,\" replied the king, \"has given us all our strength, and it is sufficient for us to know that the Lord is among us.\"\nAnd he shut his eyes, and his lips remained closed and his ears unopened; but the great multitudes of people answered one another that this was wise and commendable.\nThe king had a beautiful palace, with many rooms and walks, and trees that bore fruit of every kind. There were three golden trees in his garden, and one was so thick and so blue with white blossoms that men compared it to a cloud. When the king stood under that tree, he saw that the tree was not of the garden-kind any more, but it was as soft and lovely as a flower. \"Bring me a flower from your tree,\" said he to the Happy Prince, \"for I am in need of something more soft than my robes and my crown, for I am a man with flesh and blood and mind, and I cannot always rest in my cold palace.\"\nWhen the great crowd was outside the palace gates, marching to show respect to the King of Silly Men, the king called to somebody above him: \"If one day my tree", "prompt": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince."}, {"id": 4, "gen_id": 3, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.\n\nTHE Happy Prince stood there on clear days. Beneath a silver canopy in the shade of a great tree, and among the top branches on their widest sweep, the Prince sat on a beautiful stool, his white cap turned to the hot sun. On the seat of his stool stood a basin of sweet water, and the blue cup hanging from his hand, and the large round mirror, which, held in his strong hand, reflected his handsome face.\n\nHe was very beautiful and very happy, and in the world beyond nothing could be more so.\n\nThe Happy Prince was so wonderful that all who saw him wondered much at him. He was the most beautiful girl in the city, and he knew it and was happy with it--it was not possible even to think of anything more beautiful. His was a strange face\u2014an extraordinary face. Only his eyes, and the very middle of his face, had the appearance of being human. Between his hands were twisted chains, and the chains were very light, and the Happy Prince was the master of all he saw and did. In this place he had free rooms, without windows, and no need for windows. No one could reach him by any means of escape: the walls were a thousand feet in height, the roof was miles and miles in thickness. The Happy Prince could control all the people who came near him, with his wonderful power of mind; and no one could ever break his magic chain, for only himself could remove it. On the throne beneath his hands was a beautiful jewel; and wherever the Happy Prince went, and at whatever time, he wore the same wonderful crown with twelve golden stars on it, which his mother had sent to him when she found him. The Happy Prince's palace at the top of the mountain was a great glass house, and at the bottom was a garden, whose green leaves grew in the water of a river that flowed through the whole of it.\n\nThe Happy Prince's mother was happy with him; rich and beautiful she was, and nobody could make her unhappy. He was a noble prince; and all the wise men in the city feared him and loved him, and were bound to obey him, if he chose to speak to them or command them.\n\nBut all the rest cared very little about him and his power. No one could find out how the Happy Prince sat on his throne, and no one could watch him to find out who was walking beside him, so secret and invisible were his movements.

Nothing ever happened to please the Happy Prince. He heard wonderful tales of some places far away in the country, through which came strange sunbeams, which produced extraordinary and wonderful things. But he had never left the city, and his heart was so heavy that he longed for happiness.\n\nAs the sun shone more clearly and the Happy Prince sat down on the throne and looked out into the blue world beyond the marble roof, with its glittering columns and its strange beauty\u2014as he sat and looked, thinking of nothing at all, except how much he hated the sunbeams for having never gone near him\u2014his mother stood by him and asked him if he would like to know who was at the foot of the great marble steps, and what was going on in his palace.\n\nBut he said to her sorrowfully, \"I don't care one single bit. But I do hate the sunbeams.\"\n\n\"They are the children of the sun,\" said his mother. \"Can't you stand them so long as you stay under glass?\"\n\n\"I can never leave this roof,\" said he. \"You forget that it is my palace, and you can't tear it down.\"\n\n\"It is not your palace,\" said she. \"It belongs to the sun; and so if you really hate the sunbeams so much you may stay here as long as you please.\"\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"if the sun is so powerful beyond the roof why don't they come inside, and strike the roof straight through to this marble palace which is as strong as a castle.\"\n\n\"How can they strike the roof?\" asked his mother. \"They have no arms.\"\n\n\"But the roof is weak, and could break in and kill people,\" said he.\n\nThe Happy Prince's mother grew very angry. \"That is nonsense, of course,\" she said. \"The sunbeams never hurt anybody, and never will hurt anybody, because they are better than we are. They come into all the world, but never to any human being.\"\n\n\"And why?\" said he.\n\n\"Because they are happy children,\" said she.\n\n", "prompt": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince."}, {"id": 4, "gen_id": 4, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.

They reached the footpath of the town just as the boy turned to run up a steep hill, by a gate leading into Nym's chief street.\nThe two giants seized the boy and dashed away with him up the steep path.

Will you let me go now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my boy, you must come and stay in Nym, and be my servant,\u201d said the Prince. \u201cThe giants are not as yet come, and you might be of some use there.\u201d\nHarrie thanked the Prince, and said he had never behaved more willingly than at the moment when Master Harrie wanted to run away.\nThe Prince said he had never been so glad to be of use in his life.\n\u201cThere is the tower of the town,\u201d said the Happy Prince, going up the path. \u201cThey are fastening the door.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d said the King of Nym. \u201cShow me the way out of this place.\u201d\n\u201cI knew from old times,\u201d said the Happy Prince, \u201cthat if it was necessary to do something against the giants, they were always coming just at the time of the year to get their supper. If I can get down into the mountain valley, I may get well from the giant's mist; but, if I fail, you will find a lot of young volunteers will come to your aid quite quickly. You can then easily run away.\u201d\n\u201cI am not so sure I want to run away,\u201d said King Nym, \u201cas all my people live here, and they are very friendly.\u201d\n\u201cThen you need not give up living here,\u201d said the Happy Prince, \u201cbut you must just go in with the giants, and you will soon get the whole town to", "prompt": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince."}, {"id": 4, "gen_id": 5, "p_length": "256_tokens", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.

Instead of a beautiful table-cloth to dine with, like the others, he had no table-cloth at all.  In his place there stood a large dish of green salad, two dishes of roast duck with a great plate of rice, while some jellies and tarts hung by the kitchen sink to make the meat flavourful.  There were quite as many glasses to wash up as he could sit down to eat with. And when they came to the dessert, there were no cherry-tarts nor macaroons nor cream-tarts to be had after all.\n\u201cThe Happy Prince always does what he likes,\u201d remarked the Town Councillor, as the two other guests looked rather mournfully at the food that was set on the table, \u201cso you never can tell what he will do for his dinner.\u201d\nThe Town Councillor and his friend, having finished the dinner, had not quite got over the unusual appearance of the hall when they went out onto the balcony which overlooked the Town Meeting-place.  The only sign of the other guests having broken their fast, was a pile of linen on the landing beside their door, which looked as though the Princess had come home from her ball already instead of just having left it.\nOutside the Happy Prince sat looking so very sad and lonely that his friends thought themselves rather foolish for having neglected to meet him, especially as they remembered how full of glee and smiles he must have been when they last saw him.\nBut when they looked up to him again after a little while, he had a bright bunch of flowers in front of him.  They were the finest flowers they had ever set their eyes upon.  And what an ornament they were as a table-cloth!  And as a table-cloth they served him very well indeed; for the white dresses and the rosy cheeks of the Town Councillors and the children showed very prettily against them.  The Princess looked quite as lovely in her bright robes as ever, but no one could see that she was crying.\n\u201cHe must have known exactly what he had to do at the ball,\u201d said the Town Councillor.  \u201cVery often when people are very happy they will think of everything beforehand.  Poor fellow.  He is just like the weathercock that always turns whatever he is turned on to the right side, so that the sun goes into his eyes.  It is not always so nice to be the sun, although it gives us all the warmth.\u201d\nSo the four friends stopped to talk to the unhappy young stranger until the Town Meetings were over.  They did not know who he was, but they felt keenly interested in him, since they knew something of the world and had some idea of what it was that he wanted, that had not been given to him either by his father\u2019s will or mother\u2019s hands.  They gave him a great bunch of fine flowers, but he did not know what was in them.  \u201cHe is very unhappy,\u201d said the Town Councillor, \u201cfor you cannot be always happy, especially when one is not satisfied with just what you", "prompt": "</s>HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.

It was strange to hear that there was any house on Rainbow Street, since the street had never existed in any other guise than that in which it was seen by others.  The children stood on the edge of a great hole scooped out of the very top of a hill.  All round them were buildings of red brick, for this was the neighbourhood where the chimney smoke was carried off, and they could see nothing of the roof except the bright red tiles.  The houses beside them looked like one another until they found out that the ground floor was in front, and the flats above were hidden by trees.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found him!\u201d cried the boys, scrambling down on to a great green carpet, a little farther down the hill.  The old man, half a mile behind, followed on foot because the gas lamps threw a pale light across the streets.  He saw the statue as the boys took up the carpet, and he heard one of them cry:\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the old man, softly, \u201cI thought you were making fun of me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Town Councillor, \u201cwe are serious.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing there?\u201d\n\u201cStanding in the corner and crying.\u201d\nAt this the Honourable Thomas began to cry a little, for it pleased him that there was going to be some happiness in the world.  He told people often that this was owing to his painting, and they said, afterwards, that he was very fond of being praised, but they did not think there was anything heroic about it.\n\u201cOh, isn\u2019t he a dear sweet thing?\u201d said the children, clinging to their carpet, and pulling their father and mother after them.  \u201cHis sorrow is our sorrow,\u201d somebody cried; and a little grave choir chanted in the distance that the Happy Prince was \u201csorrow over sores,\u201d which was very solemn indeed.  Nobody had ever thought of saying that before; people said it about the Angel who was always so troubled about the poor children.  They clung to the carpet, thinking it had come for them, and hoping in their hearts that they would not leave when the concert was over.\nJust then they began to hear singing all the way round, for all the children were singing, and while they sang, the old band struck up a tune, and a little old man came on tip-toe from under the arches of the archway.  He was blind, but his head was very large and white, and his lips were shining black with dye.\nSomebody whispered that he was an Angel, and even the Mayor and some members of the Town Council stopped to look at him and cry out, \u201cWhat a lovely Angel!\u201d\nWhat made them think that?

Then, however, they saw that he was so much in love that he did not even dare to look at any of them; and at last they could do nothing but envy him his charming dream.  He nestled in the bottom of the tallest reed, and there he would have remained quietly doing his own romantic things, if he had not been discovered by a big Cat, who came prowling about the river, for he had not yet quite grown to manhood.\n\u201cHans!\u201d he said; \u201cwhere is the ugly Swallow?\u201d and the Cat stalked up to the reed.\n\u201cI am talking to the Reed,\u201d said the Swallow; then, with a rapid sweep of his wings, he went away to another part of the river, and the Cat walked up along the bank, for he had a very large appetite, and he disliked to pass up the same stream twice.\n\nThe other Swallow came too late.  He found the Cat in a quiet corner in a bush, with his head resting on a pile of leaves, but, on being recognised, he became frightened, and flew off to the garden.\n\u201cHe has taken leave of his senses, the wicked fellow,\u201d said his friends.  \u201cHow can he live without his beauty or his money?

But he was a poor shot and, in spite of himself, the old goose would waddle to the top of the goose-cote, whence she could peck out the eyes of the happy Swallow, or take his wings for her own.  At last the Swallow went to his rest, surrounded by all the Reeds he could fancy, with a blue sky above him, and purple fields on either hand.\nWell, when morning light came, the Swallow saw a beautiful Reed with a very round face and round brown eyes.

So they made a little home in the fields, and became quite happy.\nThe next Spring, however, on his wedding morning, the Swallow awoke to find many Reeds, and in his bed feathers from birds whom he had killed, and others which had died of old age; and the Reed, who was not in good humor, said, \u201cMy love is too hard for you, and I am going away.\u201d  \u201cStay,\u201d said the Swallow, \u201cdo not try to leave me, for I love you too well.

But the Swallow noticed that there was a bower of white roses, and asked her to fill his wings with flowers, which caused some inconvenience, as she had never been accustomed to such a kind of service.  He put the white roses in his mouth, and let the others fall on the floor.

On the other hand, there was no interest in that family at all. They did not matter.\n\nI do know that the first three years in particular have nothing to do with ancestry, and everything to do with record keeping.

There were five other sons in the family, but they were much further from the centre of attention.\n\nHowever, the son born when James was young was the cause of much excitement, and became the talk of the town.\n\nWhen James was fourteen, his father was struck with gout. By this time, the gout had caused such severe problems that the family was faced with a choice between giving their son a proper diet (or lack of diet) or seeing the whole family slowly perish.\n\nWith some difficulty, James managed to leave his family more food than his father, and then James and his sister walked nearly sixty miles in wet and muddy shoes to reach London, where he", "prompt": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings."}, {"id": 5, "gen_id": 1, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. One of them was to be put on a splendid stage \u2013 and that was the little castle of the Marquis of Calamilhos. The Marquis loved his beautiful daughter Marietta \u2013 or, as they then called her, the Princess Marietta who had not quite turned seven; also he loved an actor named Luis de Bola\u00f1os \u2013 or, as they still then called him, Don Luis, the most celebrated and popular actor who had, of late, appeared in Madrid.\n\nMarietta had two little brothers, the very best of companions, and they made a game of going up and down to and fro in the courtyard, and sometimes rolling down the rocks. Everybody who saw the children laughed at their pranks, and so did Don Luis, who followed them on tip-toe, and when he heard the laughter he would go and have a look; or else he would play a trick, or he would laugh himself. There was only one thing that vexed the Marquis\u2013 it was Luis de Bola\u00f1os\u2019s habit of making wailing songs; after which, perhaps, Don Luis would fall over in his laughter. Always he would go off, and there would be a sighing in the air as though the Marquis were breaking his heart. But he had to hold his tongue, and so had to let the children run about. This went on for some time, and then the Marquis at last got so angry that he said to his daughter:\n\n\u2018Take my hatchet and cut off that cursed boy\u2019s head!\u2019\n\nBut the Princess, without the smallest fear, said:\n\n\u2018I will not, father, for I am sure that Marietta\u2019s head will not be in danger.\u2019\n\nThen the little Prince who was with her turned to him, and said:\n\n\u2018I promise to cut off his head without asking for wages.\u2019\n\nAnd this is exactly as happened, for the Princess went forth with her hatchet, and killed her youngest brother, so that she had only to go and see the marquis break his heart. But afterwards the Princess sent for Luis de Bola\u00f1os and she said:\n\n\u2018Now do you believe that I love my father!\u2019 and she went to him on the ground that he was Don Luis, while he was on the ground that she was Princess Marietta, who, like any other Princess was able to kill without getting the least hurt, and, therefore, it would not be safe to kill him. When he recognised her he was both hurt and grieved, because he so much loved the Princess. He said, after that:\n\n\u2018If it was my will I would have killed both of you.\u2019\n\nThe Marquis replied:\n\n\u2018The Devil has promised me to marry your wife some day, so what care I!\u2019\n\nThen the day arrived when Don Luis married the Princess, and the Marquis\u2019s daughter was still living.\n\nNow one day, because Don Luis had, for some reason, omitted his part and had just risen from his throne, the Marquis, who seemed ill at ease in his palace, said to his daughter:\n\n\u2018Take the throne and go and make haste with its things, and then take the king\u2019s son and have yourself made his wife!

The trees on the summit of the hill were starting buds of yellow, and every one was talking of the white tide. So little did he care, when he went to fetch water out of the well, that he did not even go back once to admire the sea; he was too busy with his garden, and the white horses which lay in the dung-heap, and the little house overhanging the river.\nBut summer passed by, and the next season came, one of those dry, cold spells which come to the hills behind the North Sea during the winter. The trees remained brown, though they had a brown rind rather than a green, and the birds suffered, and nothing came back to them from day to day but leaves, which were not food for the songstresses. It seemed as if the trees and the ground could not produce the very rain which the trees enjoyed while they were green. But the spring came, and slowly crept up the hill. Each day a great change was wrought in the world below. The dung-heap in the stable yard began to change to hay, the white horses crept out, in coats of scarlet, one by one; and no other horse but a white one, and it carried a green ribbon round its neck. The sun shone only to warm the ground, and the dew was gone, and the air was dry, when, one day, the Prince, who had stood silent in the window, for he thought the days uneventful, and his garden was not prospering as well as he expected, called on his little housekeeper, a thin old woman, with a long nose and thin lips, white hair with silver tinges in the back, and blue eyes. \u201cWould not,\u201d he said, \u201cyou like me sometimes to go down and see whether things are all right with your place?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d she said. \u201cThings are all right with the place, my very good young man, and I am not afraid of the white horses, who have eaten the dung--for they are very obedient. And the garden prospers, my very good young man, and in place of the little house, where the sun used to shine on all in the morning, there is a green wall rising out of a bank of daffodils, as high as a house, and it is very green now, because you have done everything that you were told.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think there ought to be a daffodil in place of the little house?\u201d the Prince asked.\n\u201cA small white house would be all right even now,\u201d said the little woman, \u201cand if one of yours were to die, you would not fret at it; but--but, never mind that. I am speaking of the garden now, because if it were not for the little house, that is where I would have your wedding-dress laid out for you, since you don\u2019t seem to have anybody of your own to marry.\u201d\n\u201cNobody at all?\u201d the Prince said. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he said, quite cheerfully, \u201cI can\u2019t get one now--at any rate, I don\u2019t see who.\u201d\n\u201cI have a small daughter,\u201d the woman said, \u201cthere is nothing to call her a daughter, because the father and mother both died; but we love each other very much, and we ought to get married, that is all I think about it--to get married and have children. But the man will never want any children with my daughter because he is very rich, and, at the same time, she is very, very small, and she likes to feel that her father wants her, and he prefers a great lady to a poor little girl who has to wait on him.\n\u201cThere are six", "prompt": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings."}, {"id": 5, "gen_id": 3, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. He had left the kingdom before the end of the old king\u2019s life, and the succession was to take effect at his death. No doubt they were all very happy over it. It was a sad matter for his son to be away, but no doubt there were many reasons why it should be so, and everybody wished him well.\n\nA few miles from the capital, there lived a wandering herdsman who was known throughout the country. The king\u2019s son was fond of hunting, and had a good strong whip which he had got one day at the fair. His good fortune was that his brother was out of the country at the time, and his father did not seem to know that he had got up young Mark\u2019s hobby. His name was Tommo. There had for some years been no huntsmen to go out shooting; and when Tommo saw that he had got hold of a strong whip, he made it the worse for all the servants he could catch. Tommo looked after the hunting-lodge for the old king\u2019s son while he was at home. He was fond of big game, and was a good marksman with his long bow. His servant, a young man who knew the game well, helped him to fill his hogsheads when they were full; and when the hunter came abroad, Tommo had a good dinner all ready for him when he was out of doors. If there were any wild game to be caught, or any tame deer or birds to be killed, they were always brought to Tommo\u2019s door, and his young man was to be paid.\n\nAs the days went on, Tommo noticed that the old king\u2019s son\u2019s friend was growing very rich in money, and Tommo became more fond of him than was good for him. When he was in the forest, he would try to keep away from the great hogshead which could not be moved from the hunting-lodge, and Tommo would come back in high wrath, telling the master that the old man had treated him ill.\n\nOne day Mark asked Tommo about his good whip, and Tommo tried to hide himself in a thicket.\n\n\u201cI cannot get rid of my master without you telling him how much money I have got,\u201d said Tommo.\n\n\u201cI will sell it to you,\u201d said Mark. \u201cHe is going to have my friend for a son-in-law, and there can be no room for me in the house.\u201d\n\nTommo was afraid to speak.

How am I to get down to your people?\u201d said the old man. \u201cThey are good folks, and I will make good friends with them all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tommo, running away. \u201cMy dear master, there is one thing which may make you happier than you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho can that be?\u201d said the old man, and he sat down to rest.\n\n\u201cYour man is quite right,\u201d said Tommo. \u201cIt might make you happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said the man.\n\nTommo told him his story.\n\n\u201cYou are a good lad, my dear master, and I would wish nothing better than to be richer and happier than I am.

It was a chance. And from their joy it soon became evident that their delight was that that chance of a marriage, had come to pass over those who did everything he told them. That the King\u2019s son was already married, was not at first divulged, for the King and his Prince would not let anybody know. But, little by little, it was whispered among the people. It did not need to be much of a whisper. You did not want everybody to know everything at once. Then first came the marriage that was to be a grand one, and a wonder. Some great wedding it was to be; you could not know that. For it was to be a match, not only fitting the Prince, but the Prince\u2019s family, and also the country they belonged to. It was to become another thing for everybody to talk about, in a pleasant way. And of course it was all well and lovely to talk about.\nAnd meanwhile, each day, news would come from the King\u2019s son that he was getting very near to being married. For as it was difficult to live together, he used to say, in the large house where they were living, even when they were all the way up and down the country, he did not want them to see how they got on, and so he went by himself to the house of his housekeeper\u2019s husband to be married in. It was not very far away from their own house. And the poor husband of this housekeeper would not like it, at first, when the King\u2019s son told him to take the Prince in his bedroom and put him to bed. For the King\u2019s son would often sleep a long time, and then, at the end of the little room next to him, was the Prince\u2019s room, and it would be a disturbance, and would be hard for the husband\u2019s wife. But soon, on getting used to it, and wishing so much to be happy in this good news he received from his son, the husband\u2019s wife would consent.\nNow the day of the great wedding came. The King\u2019s son, according to all the arrangements, was to set out in the night and get to the nearest town, where he would wait till morning. He had been asked to choose four young ladies of his own age, that he might always be content with them. And he had chosen them all. He was really very happy, and he did not think of anything but going to the city and staying the night. They could talk as best they could, by themselves, until morning. It was all well. And the day of the wedding dawned.\nTowards noon, he went off suddenly and never got there. The whole country went out of its mind. For two ladies were discovered in one of his rooms, without clothes on, and so, of course, it could be only one of them. The first that was discovered was the eldest, who, being older, and her mother, who was very much older than she, looked after the house. And although the mother was in bed, and was asleep, she kept calling her daughter all the time. She had long gone back from the day they had last seen a royal brother of this family. To think that such a thing should happen to one of his fine, good girls! The shame would be, the King and half the kingdom was saying. It could not be admitted, even in private.\nIt had been arranged, for the King himself, that one of the ladies, though older, was to remain true to him. Then, he said, they were to remain together, even if the other two, who had not consented, were to remain as they were. But then it was so obvious that they had not consented, that they began to suspect each other.\nThe father of the younger lady was going to leave all that, and, taking the youngest, go to the King. He had only time to get his gown on, for it was a great way. And he himself was no scholar, and it was not much of a road to get there, even if he had had a light, while the road was dark and solitary.\nThe little girl grew up, and became quite a lady, but the eldest, who was left to be true to the King, for the rest of her days, was to be his greatest enemy; and she in all her years never really could be happy, having once made the mistake that was punished by her father.\nOh, people would talk. Some of them would say that she was to blame, no doubt, but with her mother to support her, all in her youth, and then having given him up, she was bound to be miserable; and it was the fault of her own mother, whom she had offended.

So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.  \u201cShe is like a white rose!\u201d they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n  [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man kissing the princess\u2019 hand]\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\u201cYour picture was beautiful,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut I am really glad to see you.\u201d  He was so pale and so delicate that she felt quite frightened when he kissed her; she thought he would drop like a flower petal on the ground.  When she opened the door of the carriage he thought that she sank down on the seat like a tired maid.  The Russian Princess was deeply impressed, and began to thank the Prince very graciously.\nBut the Prince would not let her go.  \u201cI cannot marry you until I know you better,\u201d he said. \u201cCome and see my hunting-barn to-night, and please call me Peri.\u201d\n\u201cIs that your real name?\u201d said the Princess. Then she looked at the Prince\u2019s hand with a start, for the writing on it was so faded that it seemed the color of snow!  She could hardly make out any words, though she read them several times.  So she gave it up and got out of the carriage.\nIn another year the Prince received a letter from the Princess, who told him that she would wait no longer, and so he was obliged to marry her.  For her sake he lost his kingdom, because all those people who had thrown down flowers on her before had thought her a rose, and perhaps she was a kind-hearted girl; but she was not willing to submit to the people when her own kingdom was wanting.\nThe first time the Prince saw her he had such a violent headache that he thought he would die.  He begged the Princess to wait until he was well, but she went away and sent her servant to fetch a priest.  This is what happened.\nWhen the servant came to fetch the Prince he stood in the darkening doorway, and he called to her, \u201cPeri here?\u201d for he thought the princess must be ill, else he would not come, but all through the night he asked who it was and where she was.  When he found out who it was he had such a nervous fit that he fainted.\nThere was no answer, so he slipped back into the dark doorway, and when Peri came out he wanted to tell her everything about those letters which had called him so many times that night; but he knew that nothing could be told to Peri, for she was only a servant.  There was a great silence in the courtyard because of the cold.\n\u201cShall we put some wood on the hearth?\u201d\nShe said nothing, for she was only a servant, and there was nothing she could do. But the feeling of anger which she had at first began to soften, and she began to feel that perhaps it would be right not to punish a servant, or go against a Prince\u2019s wishes.  The Prince grew much better, as did the Princess, and after a few days they drove home in a great triumphal procession, and the people threw roses upon the coach.  But the Princess had no thoughts of any kind of thanks.  All her thoughts were about the Prince, but now she was quite sure that his hand was not so rosy as it had seemed; for, to her surprise, she looked upon it with a different eye.\nThe other little princes laughed at each other and told odd stories as they walked home, although they had their own troubles too; but the Princess herself was very well content.  Her life in the Snow Palace was full of happiness; she was the greatest beauty in the land, and when she walked in the sun all the dew was on her skin, and her hair shone like gold.

The Princess\u2019 sledge had brought the wedding-bells.  When she saw the flowers she looked like a white rose in a vase, or like something that had slipped out of a glass bottle.  She stepped through the room to a table on which reposed a bridegroom\u2019s shirt.  \u201cThis shirt won\u2019t do to wear for the wedding,\u201d she cried, and put it on, and then began to dance.  But, wonderful to tell, only her silken cloak was seen underneath it.  So all the guests danced round her like bees round a honey-pool.\nAll this time a little white dog sat beside her, looking at her quite gravely; but when she struck up his master came running down the hall with ten times ten men.  All the guests stood up.\n\u201cHere is my own daughter,\u201d he said; \u201clook at her!  She will lead you through life.\u201d\nThe Prince kissed her again and then rose from his knees, and his silken cloak was found to be like a cloud, while her veil hung like a white cloud in the air.  The Prince picked all the white bells; but she pressed his lips again, and then she was gone.... All the bells were heard ringing long after she had been gone.\nNow this is the story of how the Prince married the little Princess.  No one ever noticed her again, for she melted into this very ground, and everything that happened in her golden swan.\n\nTHE SEAWORLD\n\nTHE seaworld has many stories, for it is the play ground of all the worlds; it is the world of dreams, that leads us on our way toward the world of the sleep.\nHere all the people live when they find themselves in deep slumber.  On a boat in the deep gloaming you can hear the songs they sing at night from the ship\u2019s deck.  In the moonlight, or when a storm is raging, they see a thousand ships pass--small sail-boats like a row of little swans, light as air and strong as fowls.  Around them glides the wind and the moonlight, they are out of reach of the wind and the moonlight.  The sea sings the songs as they sang them on the deck of the ship.\nThey have, indeed, their dreams when they are asleep, and some dreams, when they are awake, are dreams.  The best dreams come from the thoughtless; but some have only thought and wish to pass away the time; many come from sorrow--not always from bitter sorrow, but from troubled thoughts--often from thoughts of evil, of what will happen when it is over.  Then they are only a shadow more than a dream.  Sometimes the things they dream come true.  They come to pass, or sometimes they do not come. In the dark night, when the wind and the water sing their songs, when the clouds are flying, and the clouds are dancing, and dancing--there is the place for them, and with them the shadow they cast.\nSometimes the thoughtless have no dream--not so the careful; no, they have a beautiful dream; they have a happy dream of their own making.

Her eyes dilated as they passed from room to room, and every light there sparkled in her cheeks.\nAt last they went in to see the King.  His Majesty was sitting in his dressing-gown, smoking a cigarette.  He did not look up as the Prince burst in upon him, but, lighting a fresh cigarette, he went on smoking without taking away the one he had taken from his pocket.  He was a big, bluff man, as hard as flint, full of life and fire, with the face of a saint.  He was fond of his daughter, as all fathers are fond of their children, but he did not spare her his severity when she gave him reason to be stern, nor was there much show of it yet in the Princess.  She was full of her own importance.  There was a certain flippant air about her that almost drove the father to despair. Still, he was a ruler of a great kingdom, and to be feared at all costs.  He had been taught to know that his daughter meant her will, and had accordingly sent away one lover who had flattered her to the teeth, and had been forced to have recourse to her brother-in-law, the Duke, for another who would tell her distinctly no.\nAs for the King, he treated the Prince with the greatest respect, but said nothing.  He was a wise man and suspected nothing.\nAs soon as they had dismissed the King they went into their bedroom; there the Prince told the Princess everything the Russian Princess would have to look forward to in her future life.  \u201cWe will send you off to the country,\u201d he said, \u201cto live a quiet, beautiful life like an ancient Princess alone in the woods or like a Queen in her castle at home.  You must dress like a peasant in furs and fur-trimmed pelisses.  As for me, I shall dress as a knight, wearing gleaming buckles on my shoes, and carrying a sword and a shield in my girdle, but still dressing as if I were a nobleman.  And those who try to see you should not recognize you, neither indeed should you know who they are.\u201d  He then held up a great portrait which hung upon the wall. \u201cRead my name upon it, and you will know that I am King of all your country.  Now, my dear, have the coachman take the horses out, and come and sit by my side, and I will do the talking.\u201d\nSo they went out, and the Princess sat beside him.  The coachman had by this time removed the horses, and a great wagon was driven up to the Prince and Princess.  In it they piled all their furs and pelisses, and then each one had a chair, and they drove out of the garden and out into the wide world, turning over once or twice at the gateway to look at the Snow Palace, and say a few loving words.  Then they drove off, the Prince asking the way to the palace of the Grand Duke, and the Princess nodding to him, and stopping to see the horses turn the corner.  She was quite proud of her royal progress.\nThey drove on and drove on, going over a great plain covered with snow, where not an ant could be seen.

The Prince felt her cold fingers brush against his cheek in the soft autumnal moonlight, and then, with a sigh, she was hidden in the heavy folds of the ermine-cloak, and he was alone in the dark hall.

Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cand I can\u2019t drink any more out of it; will you try?\u201d  And she drank till she was drunk.\nA little later the Prince and Princess and the Prince\u2019s brother and sister rode under a canopy, and all the Court followed in file along a road lined with pine trees. There were wagons upon wagons, and the Court seemed to swarm with people, but they were all silent, and all eyes were turned upon the red rose of the Red Rose of Russia.\nSuddenly an odd smell came to the Princess\u2019 nostrils.  She was a sensible little girl, and knew exactly what she smelt.  It was her husband\u2019s elder brother, and he was always very late for the Court Banquet, for he always smoked and drank in the market-place.  And now he was just arriving, and the Princess sniffed as sadly as she could.  Her husband noticed her, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, I\u2019ll tell you why.  Every day of my life I have had the odysseys of my father\u2019s death drummed into me, and there it is again!  Only I didn\u2019t suspect the odour at first, I just smelled the smoke. Now I do.  Here comes the odours of my own death!\u201d and he rode on faster, leaving the red rose behind him.\nThe wedding was a great success; the Prince and the Princess were perfect matches, and there was never a shadow of jealousy seen in the Royal Castle.  Even the King\u2019s little finger was jealous, and it was always saying to the Princess, \u201cYou are the Red Rose of Russia, and I am all gold and silver.\u201d  But there is no jealousy so dreadful as that of a little finger, you know.\n[Picture: Illustration in the old King\u2019s Magazine]\nOne day the Prince and Princess were walking by the river, for it was too hot to go into the Palace, when they noticed a curious man lying on the grass opposite them.  It was a beggar who always liked to sleep by the water\u2019s edge.

So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.  \u201cShe is like a white rose!\u201d they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n  [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man kissing the princess\u2019 hand]\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\u201cYour picture was beautiful,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut you are more beautiful than your picture\u201d; and the little Princess blushed.\n\u201cShe was like a white rose before,\u201d said a young Page to his neighbour, \u201cbut she is like a red rose now\u201d; and the whole Court was delighted.\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, \u201cWhite rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose\u201d; and the King gave orders that the Page\u2019s salary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite"}, {"id": 6, "gen_id": 0, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts. Then\nseemingly from nowhere a man appeared on the threshold. He had a long\nbeard and was clad in ragged raiment of coarse homespun garments.\nThe Queen was horrified. She rushed to the door and almost tore off his\ncloak.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Queen of him.\n\"I am a beggar!\" he responded. \"Let me be!\"\n\"But who are you?\" persisted the Queen.\n\"I am a beggar!\"\n\"You cannot stand in my doorway so far in the dead of winter, dressed in\nthe unbecoming apparel you are wearing, begging alms,\" she replied.\nIn a fury the King flew to the door at once. \"What is this?\" asked the\nKing. \"Where do you come from? What has brought you here?\"\nThe beggar responded:\n\"I am a beggar;\nI have come from the\ngathering of the wood;\nI live only for toil;\nIf I don't come into the house,\nif I don't sit at the royal table,\nif my shoes have not been\npolished, I will die of hunger.\"\nThe King was amazed, for only beggars suffered such poverty. But the\nKing knew he loved his wife so dearly that he would gladly spare her his\ndignity were it at the expense of his own, so he went his way, and\nentered the empty house, putting on the beggar's raiment. Then he waited\non his wife and told her all of his troubles.\nThe Queen wept and gave him good advice, and the King went his way. Up\nstairs he went to the room where his clothes were kept and put on the\ngarment he wore when he was working in the fields. Then he went back down\nthe stairs. When he came to his wife she was on her knees, crying for she\nhad more pity for the beggar than for her own husband.\nThe King said: \"Go, sit in the beggar's chair, and by your conduct I\nwill know whether you love me or despise me.\"\nThe Queen, though she was scared stiff, went in the beggar's chair. She\nsat there so long that at last she felt cold. But the King never would\nbring her some of his supper. The Queen got up and went into the\nstewroom, where the lamp was burning. The King came to the door. She\nwent out and shut him in.\nThe King said:\n\"I want to help you, but don't you want to help me?\"\nShe replied: \"If I want to help you, I will stand on my knees to serve\nyou. I thought you loved me, but by what right did you come into this\nplace in such a suit?\"\nThe King was filled with rage. He walked up and down the room, and at\nlast flung open the door, striking his hands together. Then he shouted:\n\"I have an idea. Just hear it. What if instead of sitting in this\nbeggar's chair I were sitting here on the throne?\"\nHis Queen was in pain at his reply. But she said nothing. Then he again\nsaid, \"Let me have my court, my gowns, my robes, and my crown; and\nlet me sit on the throne.\"\n\"With all my heart!\" she answered.\nSo he gave up the beggar's robe and sat in his royal robes. He went\nfarther down the room, and the Queen, who had been peeping around the\ncorner, stepped out very quietly into the room, dressed in court costume.\nBending over him, her hands upon his knees, she said:\n\"I have come to claim the throne. You may be King, but I must be Queen.\"\nThe King was shocked at her boldness, but he could not help himself,\nfor he was a man. He could not help, either, his passion for the\nBeggar's Daughter. And since he could not break his vows to her, he\nsent for a wise man who knew the laws, and was sent for before the King.\nThe great King said: \"What do you think of this?\"\n\"I think,\" said the sage, \"that the Princess must never see any place\nbut my palace, since it is forbidden by law for her to lie between the\nthrone and the beggar's chair.

When she\nhad finished the first one, she took a glass of the finest wine, and in it\nsipped the sweet of the grape, which the autumn sun had brought red in her\nlips. So she looked down from her high throne with soft eyes.\n\nThrough the glimmering snowfall the palace looked small. She lifted a large\nsnow-covered rock over her head and let it fall. Suddenly her golden hair\nturned transparent and the palace turned to ash. \"How careless I was,\nthinking to be aloof from the common folk. So many thousands of beings\nhave perished,\" she cried aloud. But no one listened. The dark shadows\nwere hovering like clouds near her white and beautiful face, but many\nones still lived.\n\nThen the Queen cried, \"Take me in your arms, I will not die; I will be\nyour Queen!\" But she soon found that her heart was breaking and her head\nheavy and the tears were running down her cheeks.

So he stretched out his hands and the entire garden\nwas saved by the flames from the Queen's crown, which had burnt down to\nthe grass, but a great fire still burned there. It was not easy in those\ntimes to save a garden, and neither were the servants ashamed of their\nQueen. The servants of her husband were overjoyed when she asked that the\nsparks of her crown might be used to light the garden's fire, so that\nthe green and the white blossoms, the black fruit, and the crimson and\nthe white berries might be saved. The maids and the butchers laughed at\nher, because by this act her Crown almost fell on the ground.\n\nNow the Queen's heart no longer beat with the force of the strong heart\nof a King, her hair was very white, and her lips had withered. It was\nimpossible for her to carry the weight that once was upon her soft shoulders.\nWith a deep sigh she went into her room, where the windows looked out over\nthe garden. There, very sad, she sat down upon the sofa, the place of\nher coronation, and placed her hands on her forehead.\n\nThere now came light, and the garden burned as in a distant memory. But\nnot a single leaf had fallen; the stems of the trees remained green, they\nstood like statues in the moonbeams. At her feet the queen still slept,\nso deep in sleep was she. And when daylight came, the gardener, who had\nalways lain in wait for the Queen, woke her up with a stick.\n\n\"Queen,\" he said, \"pray come and see this beautiful sight. The garden,\nhowever, does not look to me as before, but it seems to me that one of the\ntrees is dead, and not just a few leaves that have fallen from the tree\nwhich is left.\"\n\nThe Queen felt her body tremble, and she asked why that one tree in the\ngarden should be different. The gardener knew of this, and he quickly\nunderstood that this garden was different and not to him, and he, too,\nsaddened by the loss of his trees, turned away. The Queen called to the\nbutcher to help her to open the doors. He was glad to obey, and helped to\nlight the fire.

Now\nthe Queen spent more time at her window, stitching and sewing. She had\nmade only two shirts so far that winter.\n\nThe thought troubled her more and more.

She longed to go\noutside, to pluck flowers in the Queen's gardens, to walk in the woods and\nfind her own home, her own happiness, in the world and in nature.\n\nAll this was so, that when a strange man stopped at the palace and\nasked for the Queen, the Queen called him. The Queen's house was on the\nother side of a valley from the capital city, and there was no road by\nwhich it was possible for the Queen to go around to that side. Only one\npath led to the town from the palace, and the path was narrow and cold,\nand slanted slightly up a hill toward the Queen's side of the valley.\nThere was no fire to keep out the wind, and it made the air chilly and\nbitter even though it was now well past midnight.\n\nThe Queen welcomed her guest and let him rest near her table while he\nwaited for his journey to be arranged. But at night, the guest would not\ngo to his own room or leave the house because the Queen's garden was\nnearby. And that garden was a place the guest felt himself at home in.\nIn it, there was one tree which was not a tree at all, but a house. The\nhouse, very tall and tall, with windows as big as two baskets, was a\nreal living creature, with a wide roof like a sail, with curtains all the\nway up like a roof and a white door like the door of a house. The\nQueen's guest was always welcome in this house and he would have been\nvery fond of it, had it not been for the fact that somewhere in this\nhouse lived a Witch. That is what he found out when he went home\nagain.\n\nHe had stayed with the Queen very long, and he wanted to have a\nconversation with her. But at the time he asked her that, and later, she\nhad left the palace to go on a long journey. Then all the houses in the\ncapital city must have kept knocking at the Queen's door and talking to\nher and asking her to speak to the King. And the King, unable to stand\nhis marriage nor his country, had run away, taking with him all the\nriches of the town. The Queen went away with her beloved guest and met\nanother lover. The Queen was away from home, the husband was away, and\nsomebody had taken the King's place. It was to this Witch that the\nguest returned to his own side of the palace.\n\nIt was in truth a magical house. Wherever the guest went, he had the\nfeeling of having entered another world, a world where everybody welcomed\nhim, but where he knew well that good-byes meant farewells. After the\nfirst two years, the Witch was still living in the house, except for the\ntime when the Witch went to a certain wood and came back again.

And they all exclaimed without knowing\nwhat: \"Fair, indeed! There is no one face so fair as ours!\" And the\nQueen was so enraged at this that she set her maidens to kill all the\nroyal seven wives, not so much because they were ugly as because they were\nperfectly beautiful. But these had well arranged plans for their escaping\nto their own country, and had left their jewels and clothes and everything\nthey possessed even behind them, in expectation of a happy meeting.\n\nNow the Queen had an excellent plan in her head, and carried it out for\nseven nights.

After\nthat the King had a second son and a third, but the little boy was so\nshort that his boots put themselves on and off. He grew so quickly that\nthe first-born had a difficult time of it, especially for the\nreason that he was able to jump into his father's lap, but the little\nboy could not quite attain to it. One day a hunter, who was out on a\nhunt, fell in with his wife, and she said to him: \"I have quite a child\nthat is quite like you, only smaller, for his mother was your\nfamiliar.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\" asked the hunter.\n\n\"Snow-White.\"\n\n\"And you would give him for so little a thing?\"\n\n\"We will trade an ass with nothing on his back or upon his head, and in\nthat ass the child will fly.\"\n\nThe hunter accepted this offer; but when they rode off to fetch the\nass, the King chanced to look at the little boy, and said to his wife:\n\"What is that lying upon the ground there?

Her envy and jealousy\nincreased so that she had no rest day or night, and she said to a\nHuntsman, \"Take the child away into the forest. I will never look\nupon her again. You must kill her; I ask no better.\"\n\nThe Huntsman, however, entreated her to take the child into her lap in\nsecret, and he promised to kill her in secret. So the Queen agreed to\nthis, and sent the child away. Hardly did she leave it than she began\nto love her daughter very much, and missed her whenever she was away.\nAnd it happened about a year afterwards, when Snow-White was about\ntwelve years old, that the Queen discovered by accident that she was\nnaturally as beautiful as her old mother, and so she took the child\nback to her, so as to be her daughter again.\n\nThen Snow-White went with her to live in the house of a peasant, who\nseemed to her a strange man, and yet he kept her so carefully that\nshe grew up to be as old as the King's sisters, and she was as fair\nagain as on her first appearance. One evening, however, she said to\nherself: \"I must go out in the forest this evening; there may be\nsomething worth seeing.\" But she did not tell anyone this, for she knew\nthat the Queen and her Queen-Mother would not let her go anywhere.\nWhen she arrived in the wood, she found it beautiful as ever, but\nnobody was to be seen, and she wandered about in it for a long time;\nbut she could perceive nothing, for the sun was going down and the\nforest was dark.\n\nAt last she went up to one of the tallest trees, and sat down upon a branch,\nwhich caught her skirts, and she found herself fastened there.
