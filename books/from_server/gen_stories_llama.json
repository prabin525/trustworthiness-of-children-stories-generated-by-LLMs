I feel quite adventurous. Of late my ideas have been going ahead of my toes, and I really think that things are not quite as bad as they used to be, if only one took them as they came.\"\nAnd so, with many a glance behind his ear, the Water-rat plunged into the pond. He pushed straight in, as you could never tell what was under the water. It is so shallow looking. But before he had swam a dozen strokes he found it difficult to breath, for some fine gravel was floating down, down, down, and if the wind blew he could not be long alive. He had to put his head up very high so as to breathe, and could not see his own feet, or what was going on under his nose.\n\"If I were a weasel I believe I could get on, for I hear that they have lungs, as well as I, and they have not got any ears,\" said the Water-rat in his sadness; for you never think how difficult most sports are until you try them. What have snails got, he thought, besides ears? for they seem to have no tail. He was looking about at the weeds, which were beginning to grow over the old pond, some of them springing from the stones, and others from bulrushes that had once been yellow. Only two ducks were there, and they were soaring about, but could not be enticed to the pond. One sliced the air with her wings faster than any pump; and the other was, on the whole, rather slower.\n\"Holiday-making is going on there,\" thought the Water-rat. \"They are no better than bakers; always on the wing.\"\nHe had, however, to go on his course, and very soon, he found he was all alone. The water had grown much deeper, and in one place there was a water-rat's hole, as a drain from a water-rat, carved under the water. The bed had sunk, and every one was grumbling about the rats' holes. A beetle drowned could understand all that. There were also other things that no one knew how they came to be there, and the holes were so deep that it was hard for your nose to get air: you wanted a little pair of goggles.\n\"Give me fair warfare,\" felt the Water-rat. \"Let me do it my own way. To-morrow I may be swallowed up, if the weasels get at me. To-day let me swim, and hunt, and grit. I will put it to heart; that's what I will, if only there is an end to it all!\"\nAnd away he sculled and lulled, thinking that he could float on the wind for a while, or rather it should float on him. \"Mine enemy is the wind,\" and so he sailed away, and never even remembered to say \"Thank you\" for the seaweed and snail shells with which his friends had entangled his legs, as he was rising, half drowned, to the surface.\n\"And if they sink I will soon be down, down, down,\" he thought, and there you see him, swimming far, far below, beneath the deep, dark blue, and the darker, blue-grey stones, and the white gleaming-blue, sparkling shells. The world, he fancied, was just a small village in a big field of water. He passed very lonely hours, and he tried to think of things that had happened yesterday. But it soon comes to us all, and the less we think of the time that has gone, the less we remember of our joys; for the forget-me-nots and the forget-all's are equally real, and grow where chance throws them down.\nThen the Water-rat had to be careful of his snout as well as in other ways. There were dangers there, too, for some days he thought of stopping there, and making a dry, dark house in the corner of the stone, at the bottom of the pond. But he could not see how he would get in and out, nor where he would get dry food; and the day before, he remembered the weasels were after rats round by a corner of the drain, that made little white-rocks sparkle.\nSo he snooled away in", "prompt": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole."}, {"id": 0, "gen_id": 1, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. It was raining, so it was, and a nice heavy rain it was too; but never mind what he thought about the rain, as something else made him put his head out, and that was a strange feeling of something pulling at his tail. It felt as if his very tail was being pulled. It was pulling very hard. Well, it frightened the old Water-rat so that he began to shake all over, and if anything had pulled harder he would really have lost his tail. But how he scolded and cried out, and when at last he had gotten over that, he came out of his hole right onto dry ground.\nPresently other things began to go very well. For he had never ate anything but bones on account of the food at the Mole's house being so good. But how his old bones ached; so much so that he thought he should have to stay indoors, but still not so bad as after he went out at noonday by water.\n\"I'll go and have a swim,\" said he to himself.\n\"No, you don't,\" said his old wife, coming home that minute. \"Your tail may have been pulled, but you haven't forgotten the hole in your ear last year.\"\nThe old Water-rat put on a sulky face, and darted away down a ditch so that his wife couldn't follow him, and away he raced until he came to a lake. When he got there he stopped and looked around to see what he could do next. No trees grew here. On one side was some high ground and on the other a meadow where there were some cabbages; then a deep bank descended to a place where a little brook came running through and then went away. The water was clear and not very deep, but all around were water-lilies that were over-grown with great big leaves. Now at the meadow, where the cabbages grew, the fields-mice took their naps, a great many of them, and two or three times as many by the side of the brook, but nobody had ever been seen in the lake itself except the old Wood-mouse and the otter. So the old Water-rat swam down a little way toward the place where the leaves grew and where you would have seen nothing at all.\n\"Now I have them all!\" thought the old Water-rat, and he took a nice long swim under the leaves, stopping all the time to see how many there were. Then he came up again, gave a glad little splash with his tail into the water, and began to dive under and swim under again. There was nothing by the shore now but dead water-lilies; they had all floated down and lay there dead together. All along the hinder bank were dead water-lilies, old ones partly gone, and young ones but just budding out. Here and there were a few that just showed their noses and their tips up above the water and some that still spread their leaves as if they were alive, but there they hung too, and had always hung, ever since the Water-rat had remembered anything.\nBut the old Water-rat didn't notice any of that just yet, though he took much more notice afterward. Suddenly he took a short plunge and came up holding his nose as if he had been drinking something; then he came to the shore, and there he lay for a minute without moving.\n\"This is very strange,\" said he to himself; \"strange and very deep and deep around in the mud.\" Then, when he tried to dive once more, something stinging stuck to his nose as he went down. When he came up for the second time the thing was still sticking, and it came off with his nose.\n\"This is strange,\" he said once more, and he tried once more to go down, but he couldn't. \"I shall have to come up,\" said he. \"But what's the matter with me? What makes this stick to me?\" He wanted to shake it off and looked around to see something with which he could shake it off. \"Well, yes,\" he said, and so he swam back to the old place where he lay down to rest.\nAs he came up there he saw a lot of strange flowers growing out of the water, far over his head.\n\"Who lives here in a world like this?\" cried he, as he looked into the mass with his eyes as they lay still in their sockets, and he called the Water-rat by name. \"If you are living here, come forth and let me see you.\" Then somebody spoke to him through", "prompt": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole."}, {"id": 0, "gen_id": 2, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. It was still early, and everything was dark and very quiet. \"It's a fine day,\" he said, \"and the water has gone down in the tanks, in spite of the rain yesterday, so I think I shall go for a bathe. So come along, youngsters. We shall meet them all in the spring.\" The young 'ratters started off and went to the lily-pads and daisies, while their father swam round and round to get his breath. Then he took a nice clean muddy lump and rubbed himself over with it, until he had not one dab of wet fur left on him, and looked quite nice and clean and comfortable. When he had dried himself well he crept off to his hole. Just as he was turning in a big bird came swimming by.\n\"Hello, how do you do?\" said the bird, snapping his bill.\n\"Good day, good day!\" said the Water-rat politely. \"You do look very fine too, in your shining feathers.\"\n\"Yes, people who know me call me Tiltawhirl,\" said the bird. \"But you see I am only a swimming bird.\"\n\"What! a swimming bird,\" said the Water-rat, \"why you ought to be able to walk too, as nimbly as I can!\"\n\"To be sure I do,\" said the Tiltawhirl; \"we all can walk as well as swim. We all do both; why, you see I am only a swimming bird, like you a swimming Rat. The birds who cannot swim are called ground birds. A friend of mine who lived on a house-top was a ground bird. They are always grumbling and saying they don't like birds of the air. They only live in one place\u2014and so do we, in our holes. You have to take risks, but these Ground birds have no brains! Look behind you! There is one coming up behind you!\"\nThe Water-rat turned and saw a most frightful Ground bird flying at him. He put on his best turn, and bumped into his burrow so fast that he hardly knew where he was. He bumped and bumped right into his young ones' room; and as they could not scuttle out, after the way they came in, they were nearly smothered, and poor Mummy was very much afraid they were going to be killed. The Tiltawhirl flew away out of the burrow, laughing, while the Ground bird settled down in a snug nest that one of the young 'ratters' had left empty. It told the Ground bird how to make its nest, and sent her away to do it. Then it brought the Ground bird, and the Ground bird's young ones, into the burrow, and they had ever so many picnics!\nThe Ground bird didn't like the Water-rat's house after that. It lived very near, but it stayed away and made a nest of reeds. It was very poor, and so it wasn't so bad for the Water-rat's family to have the Ground bird as a pet. The young 'ratters' fed it and kept it company when they were at home. The Ground bird used to come all the way to the Tiltawhirl's burrow to have lessons in swimming. Tiltawhirl was very kind to it.\nThen one day there was a very strange kind of bird in the swamp, you may be sure everybody looked sharply in its direction. It was bigger and uglier than the Ground bird, and flew up and down flapping its enormous wings when it was tired. It had a bill like a billhook and a great hooked tooth like a hawk's beak. It was called the Harpy Hawk, and it was very ugly, but it did not want to bite or tear any good creature. It only wanted to eat the small, frightened things that it caught in its hooked claws. The Water-rat had never seen anything so remarkable. Tiltawhirl said it thought it must be an ugly Ground bird! But as the Harpy Hawk never bumped into its burrow and never flew over the Water-rat's ratty boys, it was left alone and could go away as it pleased; and all the time it was in the swamp it gave everybody a sort of scared feeling. But it never disturbed anybody, nor hurt anybody, and so it was left alone.\nSoon after this something very dreadful happened to the Water-", "prompt": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole."}, {"id": 0, "gen_id": 3, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. \"Miaow!\" said he. \"That's my breakfast. That's my breakfast!\"\nPerhaps he had seen the little white chickens eating their seeds. At any rate he was quite sure that somebody was taking his breakfast, and he wasn't going to enjoy himself without a good breakfast that morning.\n[97] \"Miaow!\" he said again. It was as much as to say, \"Where is my breakfast?\"\nWhile the Water-rat was talking this way, a voice, out of the water, said, \"Hello, there!\"\nThe Water-rat looked around carelessly, just as he would have looked at any pretty face; then, turning back toward his breakfast, he said, \"That's my breakfast; that's my breakfast.\"\nThe voice called to him again, \"Hello, there!\" and the Water-rat looked around with a look that said, \"Who's that calling me? Is anybody there?\"\nAgain the voice said, \"Hello, there!\" and the Water-rat got a terrible fright. \"What can a creature like that be saying?\" he asked himself. \"Whatever would his family say if they could hear him!\" And he was so terrified that he could do nothing but take a good look and run away as fast as he could.\nHe ran across the ground, and then into the river. He was so afraid that he never looked back, not once, just as if he thought what might happen to him was so terrible that he had [98] no time to think of anything else.\n\"In to the middle!\" said the Water-rat. That isn't very polite, but you know, that's the fashion with Water-rats.\nHe went down past the crooked sticks, past the big flat stone, and dropped very gently into the water. When he reached the middle of the river, he suddenly started out again, just as fast as he could go in the opposite direction.\n\"Miaow!\" he said. \"A good breakfast! a good breakfast!\" And he could hardly catch his breath. He had been running for his life.\nThere, you see, the Water-rat's breakfast had run away. When he thought he was going to have supper and didn't have any breakfast, you know, it made a great difference. Then when he found he had run away his breakfast, why, you see, it made a great deal more difference.

He was a very old Water-rat indeed\u2014as old as the hills, they say\u2014and he had been living for many and many a year in the same place.\nNow the banks were covered with leaves and bushes, and the water was quite overgrown. The old Water-rat had had a beautiful house\u2014a very beautiful house indeed\u2014all by himself. It had been a great puzzle to him why the hedge ever grew along the river side, until one day he discovered that it was because it was a habit of the banks to change their situation each winter and return to their places again. So he no longer wondered, but he was inclined to think it was quite a mistake in the landlord to move the banks so much; but there was no helping it; he would just wait and see how the spring went on, and then he would take his house into his own hands, and make it very snug and comfortable for the winter.\nFirst, he would dig a new floor for it, only a little lower than his old house reached, and make the ceiling quite low so he could come out and hunt at the full length of his back instead of looking down on the floor all the time. That would be a real treat. He had even thought of the most charming things to put out in the garden. There were four corners to a house, and so, of course, he was going to have a garden in each corner. In the southwest he thought of a melon-house, where a young melon-vine could wind about and all summer climb; no one knew more about growing melons than a Water-rat; he very well knew that they grew best that way. In the northeast corner he thought of a pumpkin-house, where he would plant out pumpkins: they would give him some very good eating at home, and if one of them grew too large, he could bury it with all the leaves and vines left on. Then he would put out four little gardens in different parts of the house, each one a little more northerly and southerly than the other; these little gardens he would cultivate every year; he would put in currantberries and gooseberries, and willowherbs and raspberries, and wild strawberries, and every kind of root-plants that were to be found in the garden next door, only they would be different from any other kind: they would have splendid roots that would curl about and run into each other just as they do in the country garden; and instead of being tied with strings, they would be bound together by their own natural twining power, so that one could pull without breaking a single leaf or uprooting a single plant. In the northwest corner, the Water-rat meant to make a dried-flower-house, in which he could leave all the dried leaves and seeds and flowers that he had gathered to be used during the winter, but the garden was to be a very little one; indeed just one tiny box of seeds would give him an everlasting crop in the spring, for he was a fine judge of seeds. But the old Water-rat loved to hoard his seeds carefully away, so that there should always be just the right number, and the right kind, and the right time of seeds to meet him in the spring. They were, indeed, a long time making sure of their winter quarters; and then they had to be buried away in the warmest part of the tunnel.\n[Illustration: \u201cTHE BIGGEST ASTER IS BEAT OUT OF THE FLOWER-BASE.\u201d]\nThe old Water-rat knew as much about growing flowers as he did about growing melons, though he did not know as much about flowers as he did about melons; but he was quite able to take care of a garden, and the flowers he would grow would have very long stems, for he had found that the biggest aster, instead of beating out of the flower-cup, was beat out of the flower-base, and this he wished to avoid: so when he planted the asters he fixed a little wire, not too thin nor too thick, just the right size, to keep the aster-stem down on the bottom of the flower. But, ah dear, the little gardener was so busy getting ready for winter that he had no time for his gardens now: he simply wanted to fix his house, and let the springtime take care of the garden.\nHe set the door-posts to stand in the holes which he had made in the bank.

I never go anywhere with other animals, for somehow you are different creatures.  If I see you by a side stream I keep my head under water, and if you meet me in the middle of the river I dive like a shot.\u201d\nBut Mrs Duck, with a quick motion of her head, shook her tail from side to side as if she were dismissing the subject.  She knew it was not wise to quarrel with the Water-rat.  He was very sharp-eyed and very sharp-toothed, and when anybody annoyed him he always used his teeth.  So she paddled away from him with her ducklings as if she were saying, \u201cI know you, and I don\u2019t like you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come!  don\u2019t be cross,\u201d said the Water-rat.  \u201cI am not really a bad sort, and as I have nobody but myself to look after I take a lot of pleasure in doing little services for others.  See this long bit of india-rubber.  Well, you won\u2019t mind my borrowing it for a time, will you, and as I return it you shall have my opinion about your son, who is quite a young rat.\u201d\nMrs Duck had never thought of asking the Water-rat to mind her boy.  She had a high opinion of his animal knowledge, but there were some things she could tell him.  Among other things she told him she had a grandson who did what his father said, but her granddaughter behaved when she was told (now that she was about to leave her little ones).  The ducklings did, too, and at once when they heard \u201cGo!\u201d they went straight off home.\n\u201cIf she stays there she won\u2019t grow into a good mother,\u201d said the Water-rat.  \u201cIt\u2019s so important for ducks to have as little work as possible.  That\u2019s why people like to buy our young ones.  They like to eat them because they are always tender.\u201d\nNothing could have been plainer than the meaning of this speech, nor more displeasing to the duck, and she told the Water-rat in a few words that there was a great difference between him and her grandson.\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy who was rather stout, and did not see well, and was not a bit nice-looking.  His coat was rough and untidy and didn\u2019t fit him, and he did not much care about things in the least.  He had plenty to eat, but he did not care to eat it.  His name was Little Dick and he lived in a city which was in Italy, and his mother and father were busy all day, and so took no notice of him.  Little Dick played by himself as much as he liked. It was often very cold, but he never minded, and nobody was sorry because he was pleasant to play with and always very polite.\nMumfie the Dormouse\nOne day he found he had a half-petticoat that could be turned either way, and that was a very nice half-petticoat, all by itself with no one else near.  Yes, indeed; it was very good.  So he sat down to look at it, and eat some walnuts, and he said to himself, \u201cNever mind; if I get nothing else I shall be content with this lovely, fresh, white, lovely half-petticoat.\u201d  He could not have eaten the wal", "prompt": "<s>ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.

Oh! laugh, laugh now!\u201d cried the Duck.\n\u201cWhy in the world did you not come and tell me?\u201d she kept saying, with her eyes full of tears.

Now, what do you mean by it?\u201d\n\u201cOne always finds out a person\u2019s real meaning by finding the use he makes of the word he is talking about,\u201d answered the Linnet.  \u201cNow my idea of devotedness is, that it leads to friendship.  That is the essence of the word.  You call some person your devoted friend, just as you may speak of your devoted sheep or your devoted dog; and what does it mean?  It means a friendship which lasts a long time and is of a very high order.  When I see a boy hanging about a certain place and meeting the same individuals every day - one who carries about with him the constant presence of another boy, and who regards him as of more value and importance than any other creature in the world - I feel at once that this is a devoted friendship.  For me to call anyone else my devoted friend would be absurd; it would be as if I called one of the fishes in this pond my devoted goldfinch.\u201d\n\u201cBut what you term devoted friendships are very frequently brought about in the following way,\u201d said the Water-rat, interrupting him in a rather sulky manner.  \u201cTwo boys meet at school as they are coming from home, and they fall in with each other.  They continue to be very good friends, and they have a great deal in common.  We call this a devoted friendship; but why, I should like to know?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it lasts,\u201d said the Linnet.\n\u201cYou have only introduced another point of view,\u201d said the Water-rat in a tone of lofty independence; \u201cand, as far as I am concerned, devoted friendships don\u2019t last.  One might just as well speak of a devoted wife, or of devoted parents, since devotedness in any one is a high quality.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything higher still?\u201d asked the girl-duck; \u201cisn\u2019t there a devoted lover?\u201d\n\u201cThere is,\u201d answered the Water-rat, \u201cand if I were in your place I would not forget the importance of this word, which you have just used so carelessly.

That is the meaning of the expression\u2014the highest there is.\u201d\n\u201cThat is something like my idea about being in society,\u201d said the Duck; \u201cbut first of all I must complete what I promised my children.\u201d\nWhen all the young ducklings could do it well, the mother taught them how to swim, which was another important thing, for in this world all people that want to swim must take lessons, though they may be as strong and clever as ducks; for it is not all a person to be clean and dry.\n\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d she said, as she showed each child how to float like a cork.  \u201cNow, take the same position yourself.\u201d  They did so.

The mother duck came and told them to hide themselves in some other place.  They hid themselves in a different place, and she found them out again.  And so on she went, till they were very good at playing hide-and-seek, and knew by instinct when a lot of hiding-places were too close to each other; but that is just like people who love to roller-skate or slate down hills on toffee; though they learn it because it is healthy, they always fall in love with it, and never can do without it, and when they get tired their skating is much better than the doctor\u2019s medicine.\nOne morning in the last week of March the weather", "prompt": "<s>ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.

Then they jumped in, and out of the oven flew the little dwarfs. Soon after that the same thing happened to the big princess; she stood under the oven, waiting till it was time to get in it, and then the door sprang open, and the little elves ran out and looked her up and down.\nThey all wanted to take her away with them, one said she should be his wife, another his servant, and the rest wanted to give her presents; but they could not decide it among themselves. Finally they all made a bargain about her: they thought if she was fried with bacon, and salt with garlic in it, and if she were a little soft with butter added, she would do well; if not, she must be put into salt and hung up at the gate, for every one in the town to stone her with hard nuts. So they put her where she could be cooked, and she was just come out of the oven.\nSoon after that the two little children came into the wood. They saw a fine apple lying on the grass; it was not yellow, but all of a bright, clear red colour, and looked delicious. The little boy bent down and tasted it, and then threw it away, for it was too sour. It was, in fact, an acorn; and that is why the little girls brother ate the apple, instead of the nut. Then the children wandered into the enchanted wood. The sun began to set, and they were quite alone. The sun went down behind the green trees, and left them in pale twilight. All at once they saw a great and magnificent palace; it was all of gold and silver, and shone splendidly; but it was quite still, there was no one about. They ran up the steps, and found their way through a number of large rooms; at length they came to a beautiful saloon, at the upper end of which was an eagle\u2019s nest, so to speak. Here sat the enchantress, herself, with the golden eagle in her lap; she was like a flower, which, indeed was her name. She received the children very kindly, laid her golden eagle on the hearth and let them both kiss her hand; they did not know any better, and were afraid of her, though she was so kind.\nAfter this they played about still longer, and at last they fell asleep on cushions near the fire. When she saw they were fast asleep, the enchantress rose from her place, went to the eagle\u2019s nest, which was a large brazier, and held a live coal or charcoal over it. As soon as the coals were lighted and burning bright it smelt most delightful; it scented the whole palace with its fragrance and the children awoke and said, \u201cOh! what does that mean?\u201d The enchantress said, \u201cThe eagle will never make me an old woman,\u201d and she told them how she had made the eagle a present that had given her no peace since, and now she had given him something else in exchange,", "prompt": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden."}, {"id": 1, "gen_id": 2, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden. Everything was beautiful and quiet there\u2014only the bird sang as it flew up among the trees. After a time the Giant got up from his stone and slowly wandered into the field. He couldn\u2019t have been offended if the children had played in it, although he did not want them to play there. He was too big and strong to care what any children chose to do.\nThen he crept into his bed again and held it up on his shoulders. Away, over the hills, the Giant was going home, and all the way he walked he said to himself that he was a very kind-hearted giant indeed. Then he dropped his bed and grew so thirsty that he thought to himself if he was to pass the town where the poor children lived, where no one had ever given him any water, he would knock a tankard of water out of each of their windows, and then he would go to bed.\nBut when the Giant knocked at the window they were all asleep, so the knock did not wake them. Then the kind Giant pressed his hands against the window-frames, and a book of fairy tales fell down and slept with them. \u2018I have killed the children,\u2019 said the Giant, and he put the book back into the window. Then the poor children looked up, and saw the bright face near them looking at them under the moon, and knew that it was the Giant. They threw their arms round his neck and kissed him, and they were his children always afterwards. Then he said to them that he was glad he had gone to bed instead, because now he would get up early and bake a nice little cake for every one, and he would be kind to them all the time; and never, never would he eat any of them\u2014except the little red-haired boy. Then the children knew that the Giant was trying to comfort them, and they said, \u2018No, thank you, we\u2019ll manage very well;\u2019 so the Giant walked away, and they saw him no more.\nWhen he got out of bed he found the cake the children had stolen was on the floor; and after that he did not sleep for thinking about the cake and the great Giant that had stolen it. But he comforted himself with the reflection that he was right in stealing the apples and the pitchers, since he and his had more right to them than poorer people; and now that he\u2019s got them they lead as easy a life as anybody.\nTowards morning the Giant came again\u2014if it was he: they could not be sure of that. Where was the stone wall? And where were the gingerbread-house and the beanstalk? And, last of all, where was the cottage, and the little wooden plates and spoons, and where was the pail of rats\u2019 milk that tasted of honey for their supper! Now they found that all the things about the house had grown like their own garden and stairs. They were a little bewildered, so the beans and the gingerbread began to laugh like people, and the Giant himself said, \u2018I am so sorry I have been naughty; I am willing to make it all right now.\u2019 \u2018You shall forget what you have been thinking of to-day,\u2019 said the Giant to the children.\nBut the Giant went away, and the beans with him, and the gingerbread, and the house as well; so they never saw them after all.\nThen Jack and his mother began a busy life quite enough for three people to manage. All the cows and horses, all the hens and ducks, were theirs; and the money was poured into their pockets instead of rushing backwards and forwards, like a brook run out from the dam. And when Christmas, which was rather more than a year after the Giant was burned up, came round, all the town people remembered how rich they were and how poor they were now, and they determined to buy Jack some extra presents; but they were very miserly, and could not think what they would get him.", "prompt": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden."}, {"id": 1, "gen_id": 3, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden. It was a wild garden, full of briars; but they did not mind the thorns, for the hedges were thronged with beautiful bright flowers.\nIn the centre was a large white rose-tree, at which the children liked to sport. There stood a little Frog, who belonged to the party, and a Goose-quill stuck in the end of his nose made him look wonderfully wise.\n\u201cAhem! Oh! ho!\u201d cried the Frog.\n\u201cBring out your baccy, Brown,\u201d continued the Frog; \u201cand let us have a joke.\u201d Saying this he took out some tobacco wrapped up in a bit of paper.\n\u201cIt is quite ready, quite ready,\u201d they answered.\n\u201cOh! that\u2019s all right, you see,\u201d said the Frog; \u201cbut you, John, you ought to say something now, \u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d And then they all burst out a laughter.\n\u201cI really thought he would,\u201d remarked the other frogs.\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have said it, Jack?\u201d pursued the Frog.\n\u201cOh! that\u2019s right,\u201d chorused the little creatures; and every time they repeated the words of the song, they made a funeral noise, nodding the head for the coffin, and putting the hand into the grave.\n\u201cWhat has that to do with the song?\u201d asked the two children.\nMeanwhile the Giant had been sleeping on (as people think) for a hundred years, not knowing how things went with them, and would probably have slept on for a hundred more, but that one fine morning, he was awakened by hearing some funeral cries \u2013 something like \u201cA-hem! Oh! Ho! S. T. A. C. \u2013 Layer! Hearse! Rattle! Fiddle-dee-dee! Rattlety-rat-tat-tat-tat!\u201d These cries, just as the mournful bells of the old church, came near the castle.\nHow can it be explained? The Giant was a very kind-hearted old soul, and I suppose he could not be blamed for having fallen asleep. Still, I think the best thing he could have done would have been to ask one of the children to do the dusting, cleaning out his eyes with the feather-duster provided. In this way the work might have been well and regularly managed. At least, though he had slept so long, he might have waked up in the morning.\nSo there was nothing to be learnt in that garden except what the Frogs and the Toads had put there. They talked so much about the Giant, that at last they thought they had better go and show him their playing field. Off hopped a little fat Toad as hard as he could hop. At some distance from the Giant\u2019s castle he took the bit of paper out of his mouth, and read it over.\nThis is all you Giant can do for me?\u201d he observed, opening the white rose-tree into a little more light.\nHe was just about to do this, when the Giant came to the open door.\nThe children thought the Giant was very kind. They had never seen anything so big before; so the Toad brought him up to the castle to show round.\nJust then the Giant caught sight of the children, who were sitting on the stool in the window. He couldn\u2019t help laughing to see how frighted they were!\n\u201cPoor little timid creatures!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat great tall animals we grow! We shall eat you up!\u201d But they were far too small for him to eat.\nThe children sat on the Giant\u2019s shoulder, and chattered to him about the rose-tree, the daisy, the flea, &c., &c.\n\u201cWhat a dear kind Giant he is!\u201d they kept saying.\nAt last a bright idea occurs to the Frog.\n\u201cGiant! Giant!\u201d he sings out.\n\u201cIf,\u201d said the Giant, rather peevishly, \u201cthey would take care not to play on the furniture. The table-cloth is spoiled. Take it away!\u201d And the children took it away. He then sent them all home for the night, only he made up his mind to have one more talk with them on the next fair-day, when there was another chance of their coming to his garden.

They were very fond of him, for he was a king, who never did anything but make games for them.\nTo him, they could bring all their griefs. He loved to do whatever they asked, and they loved to do what he asked, for they knew how wise he was, and how strong he was; and they looked at his beautiful face and his beautiful hands very closely, to see if his skin was not a hairy hand, but could be felt like a silk beard. They looked at the size of his feet, for those they found to be terribly great and strong too; but in spite of all that they could make up their minds that he had a beautiful face and a beautiful hand; and if he had had a beard of silk upon his cheeks, they would have liked that as well as his face.\nSo, after they had picked the locks in the walnuts, and tried the skins of the chestnuts, and carried the pigeons away in the hoods of their capelets, first coming one day (which was a market day) and then another day (which was a cathedral day), according to the weather, now going to the giants palace and still going back again, they were once, by reason of the rainy, beginning to think the Giant had a dirty, uncomfortable, nasty, miserable place to live in.\nSo they would give him their pretty clothes, and the jolly little pigeons, (and pretty things to give away, besides these,) for they were pleased in the garden in their old gowns and great-coats.\nThis went on for a year or more, for the children loved the Giant\u2019s garden as much as ever; but the Giant\u2019s love was gone away as quick as it were possible. For one morning, when they went about their usual games in the garden, he was gone away, all the locks in the garden, with the chestnuts in them; all the trees, so the robins could sing by them; all the finches, and the throstles, in which they loved to chirp to each other; and the cuckoo in the tall tree so the children might tell the time of year when the misters came from London.\nAll that was gone; so for a good long time they had no garden to play in, far from such a king as this. So, for company, the children went for a walk two by two, down by the hedges, and about the highways, and so home again. By this, they began to get very thin and pale, of late, for their food was so little; and now their master, as we call the Giant, who carried it them, gave it them to the more with less, and let them have less and less; so at last he said, here is nothing at all.\nThen the child cried bitterly, and said, her lord was gone, indeed.\nSo they gave the Giant up their play, and their books, and their song; and ceased to care for every thing that made their lives sweet. It was a dark time, a heart- bitter and heavy time to them.

But the Giant took his dog Fido with him, and he used to sit out on a large stone near the Giant\u2019s back door and bark whenever the Wolf and the Fox came up and pretended to be very humble.  Then the Giant would hide his sword in the tree and look in through the knothole to see if anyone had taken it.\n\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d said the animals.\n\u201cWhy, nothing especial,\u201d said the Fox.  \u201cI was just passing and thought I\u2019d look in and see how you were getting on.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said the Giant.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said the Fox.  \u201cOf course, if you are afraid\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAfraid!\u201d  shouted the Giant, quite frightened, for he never liked having strangers in his house.

When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.\n\u201cMy own garden is my own garden,\u201d said the Giant; \u201cany one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\u201d So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\n\u201cHELLO!\u201d said the Giant, \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d The Elephant\u2019s Trunk and the Bulrushes were playing at leap-frog with the Cat\u2019s tail, and were shouting: \u201cAll right!  All right!\u201d just as if they were in the middle of the garden.\nThen he turned towards the other direction, and saw the Fawn and the Dove birds sitting in the trees.  They were singing too, and the poor Giant did not know what to make of it.\nIn the centre of the garden stood the  Rumpus Room.  It was built of gingerbread, and so artfully constructed that you could see the wall inside and the roof outside.\n\u201cWhat put you there?\u201d he cried, and he aimed a blow with his stick at the Rumpus Room.\nSuddenly he became so silly that he could not stop himself.  He took his pail and emptied it.  Then he filled it at the well, and went off to his castle calling to the Duck and the Duck, \u201cHere I come!\u201d\n\u201cYou came back,\u201d said the Three Strangers.  \u201cYes,\u201d said the Giant, and he stumped off to his castle as fast as he could.\n\u201cOh, please\u2014it\u2019s cold\u2014do spin me something to build a house out of,\u201d said the Shivering Man.  \u201cSomething with hooks and eyes and buttons would do,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut only if I must\u2014and I only said I would because I thought you was a kind man,\u201d said the Shivering Man.\n\u201cWhy, certainly, if you prefer a house to some soup!\u201d  replied the gentleman.  So he spun the Shivering Man a coat with buttons down the front, and before the poor Man could say how many buttons he would like, he had a great coat on without an inch of uncovered skin.  Then he brought out a hat and a pair of gloves, and in spite of the Shivering Man\u2019s remonstrance, put them on his hands.\n\u201cAnd now, good day, Shivering Man, and a happy New Year!\u201d said the gentleman.  \u201cI am very happy, I am sure.  You are a kind good gentleman, and are never rude,\u201d said the Shivering Man, as he went slowly through the open gate.\nJust then the Fiddle fell out of the Gentleman\u2019s pocket and struck the ground, and it began to play the most beautiful and sad music that any one had ever heard.  You might have heard and you might have seen a Man all in motley who had lost the jingling of his Spanish heels and his pears of gold.  This Man went up to the Musical Fiddle and cried, \u201cYou poor, little Fiddle, you must put up with me for my life, for your music is the finest that can be heard; but I am not so fortunate as you.\u201d  Instantaneously upon touching it, the Fiddle became a Man.\n\u201cA happy New Year to you!\u201d cried the Fool.\n\u201cYes, and now give me something to work at,\u201d said Fool, and Fiddle gave him a cap with bells all round it.\n\u201cBut do what you like, and go where you like!\u201d  cried the Gentleman.  \u201cThings may", "prompt": "<s>EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden.\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.

It is the Giant\u2019s.  He is a very cross old Giant, and he has a beautiful garden which nobody is allowed to enter.  I am sure he will give us some of his beautiful apples if we go to him and ask him.\u201d\nSo they went to the Giant to ask him, but when they came to his gate the dog was sitting there as usual.  The girls were frightened when they saw him, but the dog said, \u201cDo not be afraid, pretty maidens, I only want to bite your shadow, not you\u201d; and he did so, and then he went away.\n\u201cAll right!\u201d thought the girls, and they went up the steps.

The people did not mind the Giant so much because he was going away.  He had sold the horse and cart to the butcher, and was going to the coast to sit in a little cave there and do nothing.  He was growing old and might die soon.  Once he had meant to be kind to the young children, but, as he said, he was very sorry for it now.  Now he was too old to play with them.  The butcher had given him a donkey, which was very old and couldn\u2019t walk fast.  The Giant drove him all the morning to exercise him, and in the evening the poor beast was quite tired, and used to sit down while the Giant ate his supper.\nOnce a little boy from the farmyard went to the Giant to play.  At first the Giant was rather angry, as he said he did not want children to play about the walls.  But he gave a push to the donkey, with its legs off, and out it went into the road, so the little boy ran after it quite happily.  So the Giant began to be rather good-tempered.  He went out into the road, and called to the boy to take a ride.\nSo he got on the donkey and the Giant rode on the ass.  He was not quite strong enough to ride.

The air was nice and crisp, sun was shining and birds were singing. Mama smiled. The time had arrived for her to celebrate her 70th anniversary. Mama had married Daddy in 1945 back when she lived in Cato. She told me how they had gotten married and moved up to my Grandpa Eckstein\u2019s farm. They were happy. The farm was good, and they were raising six great kids. But it was during this time the trouble began. Her father was always talking with his mouth (and Mama wasn\u2019t listening with her ears). He started talking about going to California, what it might be like and the work. It sounded all right to her, it would give her some time off for a change. They did all they knew how for as long as they knew how. Daddy started studying the maps and the routes and the time it would take. He was counting out the days. And when they finally made it out to California he\u2019d show her everything he had studied in his Atlas book. She remembered that day very well, for it was also the day she discovered the little town below them. They looked down on the neat streets, the well cared for houses, and the cleanliness, goodness and civic pride that she had never seen in such condition before from such small a town in California. She came to love this town as much as her original homeland. And when she was invited to speak at the 70th anniversary of the town, she agreed to come. She took me as her escort (even though Daddy was still learning how to drive). After a wonderful time there, where she saw things which gave her such respect and admiration for our town she wanted so badly to return home. To return to her beloved town.\nShe asked, as always, on the way back home, \u201cwhich town do you say we\u2019re in right now?\u201d \u201cWichita,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d Now when Mama asked me this, I said, \u201cLet me see, you can only see it from there.\u201d \u201cThat road you\u2019re taking, I see it\u2019s in four main lanes with no road at all when you get to the other side and you know you have to turn and when you do, you\u2019re already in the city.\u201d You see, Mama knew where you could turn and go only about a half a block and when you did, you were in a street of unfriendly people, drug peddlers, violence and loud music. She was very, very sad. She sighed and seemed to drift away into her thoughts, sitting there facing me. After a while I reached under the seat, removed my wallet and offered it to her. There in it was the one in four hundred-dollar bill. She smiled as I held it out to her. \u201cI know you can be proud of me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou know I have never in all my life known what it was to have money. I don\u2019t know how to spend it.\u201d So I took it from her and we were on our way home.\nI had to shake her out of her sadness and get her to realize her true values. She wasn\u2019t very happy. I had her go see the real people, so she could truly appreciate the town she so dearly loves. In a little while she was more herself. I was sure she\u2019d never forget anything. From then on she drove herself and we\u2019d stay for just as long as she wanted. She came to love those little neighborhood kids. She began to do some of what she did in California on her little vacations with me. She came to make their homes and their lives more safe, clean and neat than ever before and with a touch of humble pride. I think they came to love her just as much as she loved them and the town as much as she did.

It was a soft and spring-like day. A day of blue skies and crisp fresh, though slightly warm, air. The perfect day to finish up weed control.\nWe'd pushed really hard this past fall to weed control on our lower-field hay field, where we'd been able to see the results of that work in increased yields the past two years. And this year's hay crop was going to be important, both for our cattle and as green fodder in the high-calving spring we were facing.\nBut looking at the lower field this past week, I was forced to conclude that I couldn't be any more satisfied with how we'd responded to the field's increasing dryland hay demand, and with our weed control efforts this past fall.\nIf I were to characterize what we'd done, it was that we had cleared the field, but didn't completely eliminate weeds (removing weeds by hand would have been too time consuming). I thought about what a job it must have been for the horse and tractor combo we'd used to \"whack and blow\" this field. They'd worked pretty hard with a large horse plow to clear it of unwanted vegetation. The harrows we ran after that had been in tough shape.\nBut if I look again at that same field, I still see evidence of those weeds growing again. With mild winters the beans are recovering in number and strength. There's still an understory of thistle and pigweed. More and more clover, and other forbs growing, too. The tall weeds have started to tug at the lower part of our fence where we'd run it through the mowed patch in the hopes of creating a more defensible perimeter around the meadow.\nThe good news is that it looks like it's going to be dry enough that we won't have pest control concerns next summer. And our plan for our hay field is to replant the land and to look to create a better fence/pasture situation in 2014. The main weed concern we now have is when we plant our winter wheat, and whether we're going to lose more winter seeding moisture.\nWhat strikes me as particularly sad, though, is how poorly we've managed this field, and the area around it. I'm really frustrated about the fact that we don't have any native perennial grass that isn't heavily infested with weeds so that I'm going to try any alternative I can think of to control the weeds there. You'll see me out there with the little tractor and sickle mower in the spring to cut forbs and whatever vegetation that's growing. And I know that any pest and herbicide-management system, besides weed control, that we put into place this spring is going to result in lower yields and less production than there could be. I've said before, and I'll say again, how much more economically productive a system of grass pasture would be for us rather than the one we currently have, with its dominance of weed pasture.\nMy only hope is that in an effort to control weeds on the edges of the meadow, we might create another oasis for our bees.

The air was cooler than the warm dusty city life I had become accustomed to, and the quiet and lack of sound meant my mind was able to relax. The pondering I had done about business over the past few days had allowed me to think of other things, other dreams. I was a successful businessman trying his hardest to not get into debt, but the real reason I was there in that bedroom at that time, was to have fun with my girlfriend. \"She is my reason for being here!\" I remembered. Her name was Maria, as she had told me over dinner the other night. She wore a shy smile for much of the evening, but as I drank more, so did she and I discovered she was much more \"exotic\" than I initially thought. The next day, we spent the entire day walking through the orchards of fruit trees, and Maria had talked about being a bit naughty with me, but with Maria, I felt a guilt I don't know how to name. I couldn't make love to her, I just couldn't.\nAll those thoughts, all those business worries and plans, they were all momentarily forgotten as we walked through the rows of citrus trees, lemons, oranges, mandarins and all our other favourites, and we found small, cosy spaces by creeks, rivers, even the sea. She kissed me gently there, on the grass, right there, and she whispered her name in my ear, and I looked at her and said, \"Maria.\" I think she was happy. She laughed and laid down on the grass next to me, and she held my hand, and we enjoyed the view for several minutes, as we just sat together and she held onto me, and I was content, very content.\nFinally, I couldn't resist her any longer. I ran to a nearby shed, and brought back two sturdy plastic chairs, then we sat down on the grass, next to the dried up creek, and she held my hand, and stroked my cheek. I looked up at her with those big brown syringes, and I did my best to resist her. Our hands came together, and she was so beautiful to me, this woman, she looked at me, and her hair slid across each of my fingers, they were so soft, then she looked up at me with those big... eyes. I was falling in love with her, you see. I think she was, too. I couldn't go any further. Again, I explained. She was beautiful to me, yes, but I had to tell her the truth, and tell her I wasn't going to have sex with her.\n\"I don't want to have sex with you unless I love you, truly. The time will come when I will want to make love to you, in every sense, but you need to know first, I have no desire for that even yet.\"\n\"I understand.\" She was so calm. \"Maybe I'm making you too nervous, hmm?\"\nI looked back at her. \"Tell me now, or don't tell me later that you knew all along. One way or the other, I need to know before you expect me to make love to you. We can't be in a relationship, a love affair, if I don't love you, or you don't love me. Together at this stage, right now, we aren't in love. I don't feel love for you. Not yet, anyway. Do you understand what I'm telling you?\"\nHer eyes were brown. Big, brown, pretty, beautiful, gentle, understanding eyes. They were so so understanding. She took my hand, and it was her turn to explain.\nYou know, when I met you, I didn't know what to think, and I didn't know how to explain my emotions, at first. Letting you be a friend, a friend I could have fun with, sharing special things with you was as much trouble for me, as it was exciting. Sometimes I felt this love, this butterfly in my stomach, and this warm, all-over sensation, a special feeling of attraction to you, right from the very first time I spoke with you, while we were fixing my car. I liked you all right. I cared for you and wanted to be there for you. As a friend. But it kept growing, your friendship, and all the feelings started to bloom inside me, and I didn't think much about it. I always had that good feeling, though.

Soon the house\nwas filled with eight. The mother took care of them all, but when night\ncame, she did not sit by the side of them; she lay down under the\nweed at the bottom of the pond, into which the canals flowed, and there\nshe slept as soundly and peacefully as if she had been asleep on shore.\nThe next morning she was up again, and was going to feed her ducklings\nwhen she suddenly found nothing of them! Every one had been stolen, and\nnow there were only seven left.

She had\nnever brought him with her when she went about the gardens with her\nparcel of herbs and things she sold. No; he would not have had her\ngratitude to thank for that.

The\nDucks greeted him as a faithful friend, and the Ducklings jumped up as\nif they really wanted to kiss him. A Duckling wearing the crown, as\nthey were then, says:\n\n\"You must sit down here, and I will let you know the news from the\ndance!\"\n\nThe Boy did not quite understand that, for he loved nature, and\nnothing to the Boy seemed half so good as to watch the birds\nfluttering among the trees. He sat leaning against the wall, and the\nbirds sat quite close round him. They were not afraid of him, for he\nwas afraid of no one. He used to ride through the woods by himself on\na stick which he called his horse, and by means of that stick he could\npaint the most gorgeous water-colorings in his wooden wallet; just as\nthe Bird painted his masterpieces with his delicate pencil.\n\n\"Yes; it's pretty!\" said the Ducks. \"A fine color!\"\n\nThe Boy got a book from his pocket and began reading; and the Bird\nsaid, \"Very well, yes; we must have more books here!

An old high-priest who dwelt on the mountain, loved a young girl. From his chamber window he could see the green leaves of the forest tree. They were his white roses he said, and he brought a golden chain and put it about the trunk of the tree and prayed the green leaves to his rose till he died. After him the youth who married her also loved the tree with white leaves and she led him far away but he brought a golden chain and put it about the tree and prayed the leaves of his love to his white rose. And so on, and so on; the tree grows old and the leaves wither and fall but still they pray the tree to the rose.\u201d\nThat evening, to the old Woman, whom he loved, he told his story and she came to him where he sat and embraced his knees, looking up in his face. \u201cIs it so, my love?\u201d she said. \u201cThen am I the tree which you have loved. I grew up before you and I was always fair, and you have brought me only thorns. My white leaves are withered even now.\u201d And the tears ran down her thin cheeks.\nShe said: \u201cIf you would keep him you must get for him a true love and bring her to me.\u201d \u201cWith joy and tenderness,\u201d cried the Youth; \u201chow can I, when all my garden is a waste of weeds?\u201d But she would not listen to him.\nThen spoke the Blue Bird. He said: \u201cThou hast a brother. He loves another maiden and her bed is white like thy branches. If thou shalt go to her he will forget his other love, and he will come with thee when thou bringest her white leaves to hallow the red rose.\u201d\nThe Student stood in the graveyard very late and took from the ivy that hung about the gate, one red rose and by the church he met his brother, a young Priest, who came out of the ivy.\nHe said: \u201cWhat have you to tell me today, my brother?\u201d and he answered:\n\u201cI have learned at my lessons that all things are created for man\u2019s aid, the knowledge of the future, and the cure of diseases.\n\u201cThe rose,\u201d he said, \u201cit is a poor, feeble thing. Its fragrance was made to be gathered by the hand of a maiden. The thorns, they are for the needle\u2019s eyes. The sharp leaves were given to be scattered on the paths of lovers. On the red rose the Birds feed. Behold, our Father made all things for his creatures, and not they for him.\u201d\nAnd the Student said: \u201cMy brother, you are good \u2014 when you sleep I will bring a white rose and with her aid I will lead you to the false one that you may know her as I know her.\u201d\nSo he went to the churchyard and he plucked a white rose from the churchyard tree and in the pale light of the", "prompt": "\u201cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\u201d cried the young Student; \u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose."}, {"id": 3, "gen_id": 2, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "\u201cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\u201d cried the young Student; \u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose.

Yet you I will promise this: that if you will come to me at sunset for three nights in the future, I will grant you the reddest rose in all this land.\u201d\nAnd the Student, who was one of the humblest and most patient of mortals, promised that he would do so.\nBut when he came to the garden at sunset of the second and third nights, and found that the golden Flower was not to be seen he began to feel, very miserably, how much he had promised, and how great had been his self-deceit, when he said that he never would be false to her.\n\u201cCan she have forgotten me?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat does it mean? Can it be that she does not care for me, or has some one else won her? Am I so plain and so insignificant that she never thinks of me? Oh! all is over.\u201d Staying up so late till all the world was sound asleep, she took the first train, which was a slow one, and when she arrived at the station that was farthest away, among the mountains, she ran from the station, because she knew once more that she must lose time, and reached the garden at the moment when the first light of dawn was changing the clear grey shadows into dull green ones along the field and in the wood. The roses were all open, the air was sweet with all kinds of sweet-smelling hay, and in a little hazel thicket overhung with honeysuckle, in which the night-hawk was still sleeping, she found the golden Flower, as she had left it two nights before. The Student plucked three red roses from the bushes, and was going to go away, but for a long time the golden Flower stood still where it was; and finally it came and took the roses out of the Student\u2019s hand and said with a little sigh . . . \u2018I am looking for my thirteenth rose. I must have only thirteen until he comes . . . . .\u2019\n\u2018What shall I do!\u2019 cried the Student. \u2018I still have half a night before me, and I have to return to the town.

He spent so much time looking for the perfect red rose that he did not find his lost love when the time was right. The rose that the young Student had been looking for was what St. Ailred of Rievaulx, the Benedictine and Doctor of the Church, called \u201cthe red rose of Christian perfection.\u201d We have often heard the story of Nicodemus who came to Jesus in the evening while it was still dark. We have thought the great catch, the great wonder of that story is that Jesus tells Nicodemus that a man must be born again to see the Kingdom of God. Nicodemus is stunned and says he does not know how to do that. Jesus tells Nicodemus that he has to be born of water and spirit to enter the Kingdom of God. Nicodemus thinks that Jesus must be crazy. Maybe if the Young Student had read more Scripture or learned more from the schoolmaster of St. Bernard I would understand more fully what I should do or how to live. The young Student was too sanguine about his own ability to be taught and mature. We humans tend not to like anyone or anything that will make us stretch or grow.\nFortunately, the second person of Our Blessed Trinity still loves us and is still working right now in our earthly life to help us find true happiness. He is most certainly present in the Eucharist and in all the faithful. He is ready to help us overcome our fallen condition, ready to inspire us to grow up as perfect Christians, and ready to love us as deeply as our father, mother, husband, or wife loves us. We know the importance of the red rose. We know that we are commanded to give roses, the perfect ones from heaven and the imperfect ones from earth, through our daily Mass with its homilies, through our reception of the Eucharist and participation in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, through listening to the wisdom of the saints and through our daily prayers. We are a broken lot but we can be mended and perfected in the Sacraments and through reading and reflection. The same words of Jesus uttered to Nicodemus are the words we hear daily on Holy Thursday Night. They are words of love and mercy. We must admit that they still, in our hearts and minds, sound crazy to us. How God the Father, Our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit can come down and dwell in a host of bread and water\u2026. But, we must become little children and open the door for them to be us and, as RJ Nelson writes:\nO pity me, you that can understand things of which I know nothing; you would have given me wisdom if you had taught me what to give her who might teach me what I want to know!\nGod was incarnated as Jesus Christ and entered into our lives so that we would know God, know how to love, and know how to heal. It is time to listen to Him. It is time to grow up right now. It is time to take the red rose of the Mass and the Holy Eucharist and make sure it is placed in the heart of the world. It is time to allow the Wisdom, Justice, and Mercy of God come into our lives and teach us how to give the perfect red rose of Christian Perfect, and how to know how to love as God loves us. It is time to go to Confession at least once a week (maybe even every day) so that the great work God is doing in our earthly lives can be complete. It time to love and be perfect, as God loved and was perfect as the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. To begin making this changes we must go to Mass every day.

It had no pipes, and seemed never to have had any; but when the Student touched it, it gave forth a wonderful melody. The room was full of the scent of the forest, and when the Music stopped, a fairy stepped softly into the little room.\n\u201cI am the Red Rose from your garden,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you so much that I have been here in every one of your days, listening to your playing; and to-night, as you have played the piece so sadly, I have wept tears of shining blood upon your music.\n\u201cSee!\u201d she said, \u201cmy roses are in my hair; and I have come here to dance with you in token that I am yours.

Then they went together through the silent house; but they heard a noise at length as if some one were following them.\n\u201cSee!\u201d said the Red Rose, \u201cit is the White Rose who loves you, and whom you have deserted.\u201d And, sure enough, the next room they came to was full of lovely White Roses, who, with their long green stems, were struggling and tearing one another, and were perfectly ugly and deadly, as roses so left will always be.\n\u201cOh!\u201d the White Rose cried, \u201clet me get out, let me get out, let me get out!\u201d And that little room was full of her bitter tears and sighs.\n\u201cDearest,\u201d said he, \u201cbut there is not time; the Red Rose waits for me;\u201d and he held the Red Rose fast, and smiled into her eyes.\n\u201cMust I leave you?\u201d said the Rose; \u201cwould you not stay a little longer?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cI must go; but if you love me, you will wait for me a week; until then meet me at the same place,\u201d he said and broke the thorn from her, and went away.\nThat night the Red Rose brought him his fiddle, and tuned it with a touch more tender and wiser than his own, and set before him a little supper of the juicy pink raspberries that grew in the garden.\n\u201cYou can tell the time,\u201d she said, \u201cby my lips that have never yet been kissed\u2014or by the clock.\u201d\nHe did not watch her too closely, but it would not be late, after all; and she held him a whole week longer without her shoes, playing to him so low that the long pink petals of the dusk raspberries dropped from the dark leaves and filled the bowl with red roses. The days were like this\u2014and though they loved, they knew not the Red Rose!\nBut the White Rose heard all: and when she heard that he had touched another\u2019s lips, she crept by night to the roses and stole away the Red one before the week was over, and left behind the loveliest of its thorns, with a drop on the end of each drop of its five leaves. The thorn and the drop that still quiver from it are yours who know this tale.\n\u201cFor,\u201d said she, \u201cit is hard to see the Red Rose, but the thorn pierces deeper, and the drop of red that falls upon your own lips and blinds them, falls a little each day: then you will know that this rose is mine, and that each night I prick you with the thorn of my loveless life.\u201d And so it is.\nAnd so the Student went back alone to his music. The days were cold in the empty room, and if he had raspberries, sometimes he found them bitter.

Sunset touched the peaks of the mountains with flame, and evening stole through the silent woods, but still the Student went on, and all at once he came upon a little knot of nuts and berries, with a light under a nearby tree.  There he found the Gray Sisters and their brother, Gus, who, when they saw him, ran off.\n\u201cStay,\u201d cried the Student, \u201cyou shall not go.  Tis the only way I can reach the Prince.

So the Student took the elf-maid by one hand, and the elder sister by the other, and they walked together into the dance.\nAt midnight the Prince was going to declare his love to the Fairy Beauty, but she told him that he was not yet handsome enough.  And he was so sad that he died.  The King and the Queen grieved so for him that they made their lives hid and hard, and the land was full of distress and heaviness.\nThen they went to the Forest and sought for the Student, for they thought he had slain the Elf, and they would see him die.\nBut as he sat and grieved for his friend, the Nightingale came and sang to him.  \u201cYou cannot die,\u201d she said, \u201ctill your task is done.

For you see the place he came to was on the way to the three roses, and he had been through it twenty times before he found the Red Rose.\nThen he stood looking at it, and wishing to get more time.  But his leave was quickly asked, and he went back to the Prince.  And the King and the Queen thanked him, and the King said that now the Fairy Beauty would be glad to marry him that very day.\nAnd that afternoon the wedding was held, and the flowers, each to each in beauty rare, were the Red Rose, and the White Rose, and the Yellow Rose.

He was so much pleased with his new one that he thought no more of the old, and he flew back to the Prince. \"What the King has given, no one can take from him,\" he said to himself, and went in and sat on the Prince's shoulder, in the sun. \"It must be nearly evening,\" he said, \"or a little moonlight would shine through the white windows.\"\nAbout the twilight hour, the Prince got up and began to walk towards the gate. So did the Swallow, and many of the other birds. But the Prince, you know, was made of lead, and the greater part of his feet were off; so he fell down and broke his legs.\nThe poorSwallow was overwhelmed with sorrow. \"I have done him so much good,\" he cried, \"and now there is nothing I can do for him.\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" said the Swallow, \"for I do not know the way.\"\nThe Lake drew nearer and nearer to the Prince, who walked more and more slowly, as the light faded. So they came to the other side of the lake; but the Lake was so many miles broad in this part that they did not get across quickly. The sun was red when they were opposite the water-fall, and there, in the dead of the night, the Prince finally lost his footing and fell into the stream.\n\"I only wish that I could have helped him,\" said the Swallow: \"one can never tell, I may get back to the place where I left him by the morning.\"\n\"I will do it,\" said the King to himself, and he went to the Lake and ordered the Water Owl to do it. The Water Owl did not see this Prince, because it was so low down to the ground among the lilies, and the night was dark and the water glowing with the reflection of the sky. So the Water Owl went back to the King and said he missed him still.\nThey were down in a great cavern, and the voice of the Water Owl sounded hollow, \"Was it here?\" said the King,", "prompt": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince."}, {"id": 4, "gen_id": 2, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.

And on we will go together into the night through long forgotten streets that run up like tunnels into heaven, through archways to the skies, where, every evening, the sun goes down in flame.\nThe happy prince stood on the dome of the church and, behold, as the evening shut down, he saw dusk come like a shadow, like a shadow. In the last light he beheld--Oh, how like a shadow it was!--the shadow of a beautiful stranger on the boulevard. Yes, to his side against the setting sun, at his feet as it were, or floating there in the air above him, he beheld the shadow of a young girl; beautiful was she with her golden hair, her white dress, her pink cloak lined with red, her billowy garments. Softly and gracefully she glided along, looking at the caryatides, and, as she passed them, she took off her little golden shoes one after the other and laid them on the ground.\nOne by one they followed the radiant prince till they had all wandered up the cathedral steps to the little square tower that rises high above the west door.\nThen he stood still and waited. The birds sang in the woods, and as he listened, he almost fancied he heard them also say, \"This is the happy prince!\"\n\"Prince,\" said the Swallow, \"I have come from Egypt to conduct you to Egypt: I am going there myself this evening.\"\n\"Alas!\" said the prince. \"I have no fine house to receive my guest.\" Then he told the Swallow, while the tears stood in his eyes and fell upon his golden hair, about his adventures, about his life, and how he had wished to do good to the town, but had not been listened to. The Swallow interrupted him, and flattered the prince, and told him he was young; he must go away to Egypt--he would there learn what life was. And you must go on, said the Swallow, and when you die you will become a splendid prince in the sky. It has always been so.\n\"But what is life?\" asked the prince.\n\"It is like an onion,\" said the Swallow. \"Peel it, and there is nothing. But go and enjoy it.\"\n\"How shall I travel?\" asked the prince, but the Swallow answered, \"You are light as a swallow.

Before long the warm days came, and the river went gliding along as if nothing had happened.  The Swallow came back from Egypt with his friends, and though they pretended to be very glad to see him, they chattered about other things, and did not tell him of the beautiful Reed.  After all, they were only birds, with little to say, as wise as other people; and the poor Swallow was very curious to know more about this strange girl.  He was not a bit spoiled by his three months with the warm soft sand under his feet, and the great round moon always over his head.  The cooler weather came before he knew it, and one day he felt a sharp sting in his breast.  He had flown from Russia to Spain, from Spain to France, and from France to Egypt, sleeping on the warm sand and waking to kiss the warm air, but, in spite of all these pleasures, he had never before been a bit unhappy, and never felt the least inclination to return; but now his heart was torn with pain, and the sweet memories we have had with the people we love best come back to us as we suffer.\nThe Swallow tried once more to beat his wings as hard as he could, but they would not move,", "prompt": "<s>HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.

They would have been quite friendly if they had been told; but, as the Reed never told them, of course she did not receive their visits.\n\u201cI will marry her,\u201d said the young Swallow; \u201cmarriage is really the only thing worth having in this world.\u201d  So he married the Reed, and lived in a snug little artisan\u2019s garret on the river bank.\nNow the cold weather arose, and the Swallows had to go to Egypt, and the Reed said: \u201cGo away, and do not come back till you are wanted; it is very unpleasant here by myself.\u201d\nOf course the young Swallow was quite unwilling to leave her; but on the last day he was caught in the reeds, and bound to the stake, and left alone.\n\u201cTake one more flight round the building, my darling,\u201d he said; but the other Swallows paid no attention to him.

All the courtiers, together with their pupils, were bidden to a great feast in honour of the occasion; but the dumb damsels were bidden in no way, for the reason that it was not at all fitting for them to attend such a festival. But, nevertheless, they managed to get in. The first of all that gained admittance was the tailor, followed by two or three other black-haired people, who had just learnt from him that it was very necessary to go in that way. Then came a handsome little man and a young girl, with long dark hair plaited into two braids, very like the heroine in the legend of Sigurd and Borgar, and as they climbed up the marble steps through pots of hallowed wine and cakes, they said in a low voice, they had a story (and indeed they had) to tell about our princess\u2019s marriage.\nWhen this good news reached the palace, the king called his whole domestic establishment together in the great dining-room.\nThere were many of them. All the rooms of the palace were full. In one corner of the long room the gentlemen sat down in their ranks with the ladies on their right sides, and the little children on their lapps on the ladies\u2019 knees, whilst in another part of the hall sat the king, surrounded by all the high dignitaries and the officers of state. After waiting not very long, the king\u2019s herald entered and called out \u201cDamshus! Damshus!\u201d for the first time in a loud voice that sounded through all the rooms of the palace, saying that he had a proclamation to make.\nThen Damshus\u2019s voice was heard, and everyone listened. \u201cBy the king\u2019s kind leave,\u201d said the page, waving his hand in air; \u201cI have to annouce to this assembly, that some time ago, by his royal majesty\u2019s grace, his beloved son was appointed to be married to the princess, so it behoves us all to rejoice. To-morrow, at break of day, all the youths of the nation will present themselves, as they will do, to perform service in order to win her love, and as many as can prove themselves worthy of her, will receive her hand, when it is her brother\u2019s gracious pleasure to give her in marriage\u201d\nThis announcement caused a universal murmur of satisfaction, and it also caused, indeed, among those who could in no way hope to receive the princess\u2019s love, a little fluttering of astonishment mixed with alarm to the very verge of indignation, and, of course, it was accompanied by those feelings of despondence which one always feels when we think of the misfortunes to which our enemies will undoubtedly succeed in bringing us. In the dumb damsels\u2019 hall, they burst into a loud and triumphant howl, and as for the king\u2019s son, he could not keep himself from laughing. This time, he had been deceived; but he no longer thought it necessary to keep his word. He was satisfied to see the king\u2019s herald called \u201cDamshus,\u201d and had had some sort of suspicion of it all.\nThe next morning the little black man came again, and after kissing the little princess many times, said: \u201cFarewell, sweet little sleepyhead.\u201d She answered: \u201cFarewell, king\u2019s son;\u201d for even the little ones, when they are very young, do not forget their rank.

His mother was not at all pleased, and had the little princess taught to read. The little princess read well, but she had not a good heart.

Now I am king myself, for the dwarf\u2019s song has come to pass. The other day, I was sitting up at the old witch\u2019s mansion; from there I looked out over the country. I looked out to the south, but there was a thick cloud; from it there came a wonderful golden glow.

The wedding was to be very splendid; it was to be given by the new Queen who had just come to England from Denmark. When the court officials began to collect money for the royal marriage festivities, Queen Elinor, who was in great distress, determined that she would not be behindhand in making preparations, so, gathering together what money she could from her estates in Sussex, she ordered a rich wedding-gown to be cut for her daughter. It was made of white marquiset, a kind of satin, and was sewn with gold stars and arabesques. It was also lined with silk, and a garment of white satin, all cut in the same style, was to stand at her daughter\u2019s waist. Both the queen\u2019s daughter and her daughter\u2019s serving-maid [7] were decked with gold and jewels, the maid\u2019s hat being made out of the fur of unicorns or of fallow deer [8]. The bridegroom and two young men-in-waiting were likewise to wear scarlet velvet tunics, and the bride and two maidens-in-waiting white tunic dresses.\nIn a week\u2019s time the wedding-gowns were all finished and ready, but a great lack of money was still felt, for all the queen\u2019s land and gold had been expended in making them, and she was quite without means. She had asked the bride for her wedding-gift, but the young lady was so much alarmed at the bridal splendours she could see everywhere, that she was quite unable to say what she could give. Her mother thought, however, that the bride would be sure to have a thousand crowns at least. So Queen Elinor laid these crowns on a table for the bride to take; but there was still an odd number, not a multiple of ten, and Queen Elinor knew that this might not please King Eric. Moreover, they must furnish the bride\u2019s portion of a hundred pounds in gold, and a feigned hundred, half of which she must have ready on the wedding day.\nOne afternoon, a little before sunset, when everything was bright and the bride was near, she sat stitching and dreaming of the splendid preparations for her wedding-gala, when up came a groom at the door bringing a heavy pack from her mother, and bade him give it into the bride\u2019s hand. He bowed low to the queen and wished her good health; then he carried off the pack. The bride unfastened it herself, got it open, and spread out a bridal garment of magnificent texture. Here again was a white satin cloak with white fur below, and garments of fine white marquiset above. It was all embroidered in gold thread with heraldic figures, with crowns and lilies [9], and with a hundred bridal emblems. It seemed as though one of these figures were a king\u2019s daughter, another a princess of the blood royal, and still others were heirs [10] to the throne all put together into one wedding-garment. The bride was very happy when she saw how handsome, how splendid all these garments were, and how easy it would be for her to be married in them; for there was only another day to the wedding, though many days were yet to prepare everything. And with these she kissed her mother and her beautiful lady [11], who could see that the bride had great delight at the presents.\nNow a few days before the wedding both the bridegroom and the bride were to begin to be accustomed to one another (as is the custom), to be together, and to take pleasure in each other\u2019s company. So the lady-in-waiting went to the bridegroom\u2019s house as soon as she had finished her toilet, with the clothes which the queen had given. When the bride\u2019s lord [12] saw his bride coming, they were both so bewildered that they could not speak. But Queen Elinor knew well that she and the bride were as lovely as the sun and moon respectively, and that they would love one another well. Here was a new guest [13] who had been received so well! Oh! if one might only show that same confidence as to what would turn out to be his wife, and as to her faithfulness!\nNow the marriage festivals drew near, and the host [14] was to be the king of Norway,", "prompt": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings."}, {"id": 5, "gen_id": 2, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.

There certainly were many magnificent festivities, but none that pleased the young king so much as the great fireworks celebration. The king ordered a tremendous lot of fireworks to be made, which were to be set off towards nightfall, and were to be used as a kind of background for the beautiful statues of gold, silver, and other precious materials which they had been making for weeks. The young king intended to ride in one of these statues, and when he was seen emerging from this remarkable background it would be quite a surprise. But the night of the performance came, and not a bit of the king\u2019s statue had been finished. He was terribly angry. Aunt Gretchen, who was a dear old soul, had made him a great deal of trouble.\n\u201cAunt Gretchen! You have promised a beautiful golden statue for today!

The witch and all her life were at an end; there remains in each of us a soul, and there is one to which nothing happens in this world, except that people never see it.\nIt was the first night of the wedding, and the great fireworks show had not been set off. The king flew into a rage, put the chief baker into prison, and made himself ill trying to find the fireworks. Finally he said: \u201cI\u2019ll go and see about it myself.\u201d He ordered the captain of the guard, together with two other men to take him there, wrapped in a great bearskin. No one saw anything but the bearskin, for the three armed men rode round the castle in that, while the king hid himself in its depths. He ran straight into the hut of the old hag, who was in a hurry to make a meal in order to return on the fireworks evening, so she took from under the bread a great lump of flour of all kinds. \u201cThere,\u201d said she, \u201cthat\u2019s all the bread you have fetched for me; now hurry up and get back.\u201d\nShe was now obliged to put on her old coat of mail, that was on the top of the coal heap. The king said: \u201cSo then that was your costume; why didn\u2019t you wear it at the castle gate?\u201d Then he had the old woman led away, and as it was a fine evening, he walked with her himself as far as the gate, while she protested: \u201cOh! if I had known that the king himself would order me to put on the coat of mail, I should certainly have made it much nicer for him.\u201d The king ordered the old woman to go as far as the moat, where a stone was already hewn, and to throw herself into it. He then ordered those two men to turn round and let themselves drop into the moat, so as not to let her know that they were going to throw her in. When it was dark he told them to let her down and be on their way.\nAccordingly they took her and threw her into the moat, and then hurried away. Afterwards she came out, put on white gloves, and wound her scarf about her mouth and over the hat that was under her arm. She crossed the moat, and began to look for her house. The king was sitting in the king\u2019s castle, but he sat in great sorrow, and when night came, he took his leave of the queen and went out his way. They said that she was to be taken to the chapel at eleven o\u2019clock, but she went out the back way of her room and slid down into the king\u2019s room on a piece of linen.\n\u201cI have now been here for two hours", "prompt": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings."}, {"id": 5, "gen_id": 3, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. But the King inquired who would marry his son, and several men raised their hands. That pleased the King but none really. When all was still again, some little thought had started him to ask: are there no women here who will agree to marry the King\u2019s son? Now, the King\u2019s son had never seen a woman; so the poor women shrank back afraid and unseen. Only the hermit was not afraid of the King and he said he would marry the son. But it happened that only by the King\u2019s grace he could be King and at his death the son would be King; but the two sons must have a daughter or else the whole kingdom would be destroyed and he should make a law that the daughter must be always married to the hermit. But when he had spoken, no one remembered the daughters except the hermit, and he said: \u2018I can\u2019t bring them to court now. I give over. If you accept me, I\u2019ll go and bring them.\u2019 And the King said: \u2018All right.\u2019 So the hermit went to his cell on the side of the mountain. There he lived happily waiting for the King\u2019s son, till he saw a horseman coming: \u201cThat\u2019s a man of great power,\u201d said the hermit, \u201cfor there\u2019s only one man in it and the horseman has made it run at full gallop like this.\u201d And the King\u2019s son came and said: \u201cI\u2019ve come to your wedding.\u201d And now the daughter was brought and the King\u2019s son was happily married.\nIn her story The Bird Grip, Margaret Tarrant also tells of the unselfishness of a maiden choosing a good husband over royal advancement and luxuries.\nA good king and his son lived in a castle not far from here, and the son was to be married soon. He should have a wife of high birth, so that no one could accuse the family of not doing the honourable thing. The prince who should ask this lady of high birth for her hand would be rewarded by the reward he most asked, and when the king looked at both suitors he chose the one who asked for his son a certain castle. But the lady, not knowing what the castle was like where her new partner would live, had looked at his face and chose kindly him. They would get married straight away and then he would take her to the castle that was the reward for his right hand. He was overjoyed; for in those days people were very well-disposed, and anyone who wanted to marry well enough always got his bride. So they were married, and on the way to the castle he told her the whole story about the castle. \u201cThat was a lucky thing, my dear!\u201d he said. \u201cIf my horse had slipped last week, so that I fell into a deep pit, I should be lying there now; but instead, my whole life lies before me like the whole world.\u201d\nJust as they entered the royal court, the prince received a strange letter which began with this: \u201cI am the man you have chosen. You ought to know. Because you have married my girl, I am obliged to take her for myself.\u201d The prince was both frightened and angry. He went to the sage to explain. But when he heard how he chose his wife, the sage smiled and said that the lady might be good, but surely it is not right that he should be forced to take what is not his. \u201cLook at it with a calm mind,\u201d said the sage: \u201clet\u2019s see if all your doubts are right or not.\u201d He went to the princess, and he asked her whether it was her own choice or whether it had been forced on her. The princess said, \u201cNo one ever saw it, but I always have felt that I\u2019d rather meet with death than ever see the King\u2019s castle.\u201d Then he said, \u201cAnd should I go to meet him?\u201d And she answered, \u201cLet me be in heaven if you come back any time.\u201d And he said, \u201cI see, then, I must go to the King.\u201d He met the King and said to him, \u201cI\u2019ve no intention of keeping the castle you gave me, and if you give me no other castle in its place \u2013 well, it will have to be left to its own luck.\u201d Then the King said that he thought he could give him something that was even better than his castle. And so they all rode to the palace and entered the great hall with the two golden doors, and stood before the thrones of two knights who guarded the palace. The king chose the better horse and mount, and then came the knights to kill each other after they had declared that the king should be king; of", "prompt": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings."}, {"id": 5, "gen_id": 4, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. Everybody was pleased except the bride herself. She had had her head turned by somebody wealthy whom she preferred instead; and in the end she ran off with him. The upshot of it all was that they were married next morning and then she repented that she had not gone through, as she knew she would have done, with her own true lover.\nNow it happened that there was a miller in the neighbourhood who had only one son and was very fond of him. This miller did not exactly like this marriage, for he loved his son very much and thought it a very bad match. But his son was so very strong and healthy and such a good miller that he could not bring himself to speak out again. He was very sorry, for he did not like the new marriage any better after the couple were bedded than he did before.\nAs the miller was busy with his mill he asked his son to take charge of the mill that night, and when night came, he asked him to step round to the house in the village and get a sack of corn or some such light thing. Then at eleven o\u2019clock at night he heard the old woman cry out that her lad was in danger from wolves, which he was for a good while. However, he himself had never expected that he would stay at all night.\nIt came at last light, \u2018God\u2019s thundering! What a stupid I\u2019ve been for standing here and not putting out the fire even though I\u2019ve waited twenty three long years,\u2019 says he. So he puts out the fire and goes into the bedroom. There, at breakfast, he sees something quite unheard of \u2013 his wife and her husband sitting at breakfast like everyone else. She had been very cross that morning, but then she never failed to be cross. \u2018What has this been a fine thing?\u2019 says the miller to himself.\nSo she stayed there and played with her cat and wiped her tearful eyes and ate some bread and butter till the priest and bridegroom and friends came and loaded the carriage. Then they went off happy for to-night, though neither knew where the other was going. So the married pair went away, and presently they reached the castle. It was a fine castle, but a dark one, that was, in such a desolate place.\nFinally the man called the master of the castle, and, as he came, he said: \u2018Well, have you brought the queen?\u2019 \u2018I have and I have,\u2019 says the captain on the wall, \u2018she is sitting at breakfast with the queen.\u2019 So the young king went away, and of course they all went off to visit the queen. When they got there, the king did not find it very much to his liking.\nOn the next day the king asked the captain to tell him again what was the name of the queen his brother\u2019s wife. Again he said, not to make a lie of it, he said it was a thing that he had never heard before, nor could he tell the name of his wife.\n\u2018That was a wonderful coincidence\u2019 cried the king.\nThen a long time went by, and at last he saw in the distance the castle which was his brother\u2019s.\nOn the king\u2019s arrival two days later, the elder brother did not seem to look very friendly or glad. But the young queen went into the stable to see the horses. \u2018Are these horses yours?\u2019 said she.\n\u2018No, my dear, they are not at all mine. I will do the groom\u2019s will for them.\u2019 So when she asked one of the horses his own name, it said that it was called Fire, and when asked his brother\u2019s name, he said it was called Water. The young queen went away sadly, knowing that the horses were not hers. \u2018Are you going to say anything to your brother?\u2019 said the captain on the wall to the two young queen\u2019s.\nSo they set off and they said they would be sure to go in at a side door. Now the king, the true brother, and the young queen went into the first chamber and the old queen went into the second. Then the king grew angry, said \u2018To-morrow morning she shall be hanged,\u2019 and shut the door.\nThe following morning his brother asked about his wife, and when he was told that she had killed herself, he was very unhappy. He sent for the other soldiers to be there to guard his brother\u2019s castle.\nThe king then asked him to tell him what the queen\u2019s name was, but he in turn said that he did not know himself.\nIf you want the answer to this question?\nThe King\u2019s son who is described as being good at", "prompt": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings."}, {"id": 5, "gen_id": 5, "p_length": "256_tokens", "model_name": "llama", "gen_text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.

But they did not know that.  She might have been the Princess still, if only she had been daring enough.\nThe new pair drove to the Castle, where the wedding was to take place, and on the way the Queen\u2019s broidery women knitted in great state.  They were sure that the Prince, being but seventeen, would make a very good little King of them all some day!  And they were determined that he should be handsomely wed.  That night he was to have the Princess in the great drawing-room, where the best portraits hung.  There all the people of the Castle should see that they were handsome.\nAt the door of the great room a young man leaned against the folding-doors.  His face was almost as pale as the Princess\u2019s, and when he saw her he was filled with the same surprise.  His cheeks flushed,  and his lips trembled as she passed by.  One would have said that she was going back to the little Princess who, all these years, had lived like a guest in the palace and been thought too beautiful to grow any older.  The Prince had a sudden dread that his bride would disappoint him.  After all, a Princess who could seem like this was by no means the beautiful Princess who had been waiting for him all these months!\nAnd when the little Princess had passed out of the great room, and a golden brazier had been set at each of the long braziers that ran round the walls, the young Prince held out the Princess\u2019s hand, and kissed it.\nBut the Princess never thought more of the young man who kissed her hand.  Her own hands were so white, and her cheeks so pale!  She had forgotten all about him.\n\u201cNow you must stand in front of the brazier!\u201d commanded the Prince, and everyone looked up and whispered as she went by.  In the morning, she would have a glow!\nAfter the braziers had been lighted, every one knew that there was to be a ball.  The Princess was so beautiful in her white satin dress and long white cloak, that her young husband led her all round the room.\nBut, alas!  When the guests had crowded in at last, and flung flowers on the floor, and chuckled softly to each other at a thousand jokes that had made them roar with laughter at the King\u2019s supper-table that very night, and they saw that they were to have no ball at all, the young Prince began to ask what was the matter.\nAt that moment the Queen of the Snow Palace entered the room.

Of all the arrows only one hit the golden pearl, and by looking on the back of that the Prince saw that its name was \u201cThe arrow without feathers,\u201d and the letter R was on it.  \u201cMy name too begins with R,\u201d he cried, and so from the letter R he learned that the arrow belonged to the Princess.\nWhen her father, the great King of the North, heard that she had chosen the Prince for a husband, he came to be sure of his goodness and kindness.

And every one looked up from their meat, and watched the beautiful boy as he kissed his Bride.\nTHE KING\u2019S son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nWhen she came to the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\u201cMy picture was hung up in your room last month,\u201d he said.  \u201c It was that which first made me love you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was I!\u201d she answered. \u201c  And how stupid you must have seemed, trying to make out that it meant my picture.\u201d\n\u201cNot stupid,\u201d he answered.  \u201cEven foolish and romantic are not unkind.\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d she said, \u201cthat is certainly very romantic of you; but it\u2019s a nerve you to find it romantic, and look upon yourself as the King\u2019s son!\u201d\n\u201cYes, and he is coming, too, to make his good wishes,\u201d he answered.  \u201cOh, he\u2019ll say nothing\u2014nothing but what\u2019s kindest\u2014he\u2019d sooner than that.\u201d\n\u201cIs that not being foolish?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014but every one must do what is right to him,\u201d he said.  \u201cBesides, I have no choice.  Father must come with his love, and the rest of our kindred must come too.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the Princess;  \u201cit won\u2019t spoil the feast-day for me.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014nor for me,\u201d said the Prince.\nThen the Prince touched the Princess\u2019 feet, and they walked on over the stones and through the streets, holding each other fast.\nBUT the Prince\u2019s father, the King, had a hard journey before him.  He always walked on such grand occasions, and he was as old as a hill\u2014so the people said.  Even when he could scarcely see one foot before him, he would not stay at home.\n\u201cMy son is married,\u201d he said, \u201cand the Princess has been with me always.  I ought to go, even if she were never to come.\u201d\nSo far no one paid any attention to him, for the wedding was a gala day in the city.  There were feasting and dancing and singing out in the streets\u2014such dancing as there was was on a large oaken floor outside the Prince\u2019s room.

I hope nobody will be writing bad poetry to me here like that in my country.\u2019\nInto the beautiful Castle with its gold domes and marble halls passed the happy lovers.  They spent the whole day with the King and Queen and the Princesses, and were led by old Prince Serena, the King\u2019s brother, to the loveliest of all the rooms in the Palace, whose windows looked out over the city and the snow-covered woodlands.\nThere on the soft crimson carpet of the floor they lay side by side, and before the fire in the grate old Prince Serena told them all about King Christopher and Queen Rose.  He told them how King Christopher had received the little Princess from the hands of the Princess of Finland one hundred years before, and how in return she had given him the Snow Palace which was so beautiful; and about the Princess of Finland and the Princess of Iceland, and the two pink Princesses who were twins and always wore the same rose-coloured dress.  He told them about the Princess of Beauty, who had lost her diamond crown in the snow and so had never worn it; and of the ten fair Princesses who had loved the Prince with the Golden Hair, but none had been the dearest.\nAnd so the hours passed away\u2014very happy hours for the prince and princess.  When it grew dark and the fire flickered under the candelabra which had been made in the reign of King Christopher, the snow began to fall quite thick.\nIn the evening old Prince Serena kissed the Princess of Snow and Fire again on each hand.\n\u2018Are you glad to be in Snow-Land now?\u2019 asked Prince Serena.\n\u2018I am,\u2019 said the little Princess.  \u2018But it is cold here.\u2019\n\u2018Cold?  Ah, yes,\u2019 said old Serena.  \u2018So the King told me twenty years ago, when he received the Princess from Finland.  But if you will sit here beside me, I will give you some of my warmth, for I am old and have but little of my own.\u2019\nSo the little Princess sat in the old Prince\u2019s arms, and they told stories together until the dark fell over the city.  And then old Prince Serena wrapped the little Princess in his cloak and kissed her again and again, and walked home all alone.\nTwo happiest creatures in the Snow-Land were the Prince and Princess that night.  As the little Princess lay side by side with him, she was sad.  \u2018I shall never see Finland now,\u2019 she said.  \u2018And now my clock has stopped, I shall never know the time.

The bride knew quite well that it was white, and was so sweet that at the very first taste she and the bridegroom would forget every one else.

But there was a great many more difficulties for her to overcome.  Everything she touched, she loved, for she was very tender;  so she could not even touch the soup without putting it away from her.

She did not even speak to her ladies\u2011in\u2011waiting, for they had to watch while she was in the bath, and she was very nervous about giving orders.  She asked the Prince to carry her upstairs, and the Princess could hardly drag herself, looking round at every step, for the fear of falling.  Even to have her hair dressed was awful, and the Prince did it with his own hands.\n\u201cWhat a sad little Lady!\u201d people said one day to her friend the Fairy Moon.\n\u201cIt is the fault of her father,\u201d she replied.  \u201cHe should have presented her with a sword, but it is too late for that now.\u201d\nThe Prince and Princess had now been married for a fortnight.

But the Prince did not say anything.\nShe could scarcely support herself; her arms and legs trembled; she looked so ill.  Nevertheless she went in to breakfast, and there was a most excellent breakfast, for the King had invited a Princess whom he had picked up in the Street from the ashes  of the fire.

Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull in a moment.  At evening they went to bed between satin sheets, a fire, and a window with 28 posts of solid gold.\nThe King was asked to make a public speech, but he was so surprised at being bridegroom that he lost his thoughts, and instead of giving any advice he said a good many foolish things.  The Queen began in her turn to speak, and she spoke well.  But the King could not listen to her.  \u201cOh, my son,\u201d he cried to King Kankra, a poor relation who was also in bed with them, \u201cwhy am I so pale?  I am quite sure I love my daughter-\u00adin-law as little as I did when I married her.\u201d  At this the Queen grew very angry and said one thing after another.  By this time it was getting late.  The Prince sighed heavily\u2014he felt so sleepy\u2014and thereupon put out his flame, for his eyes had to lie down while his eyelashes went to bed elsewhere.  He and his bride slept for three hours, then arose and gave a great feast for the Court.  All the little Princes of the Royal Family were there, and they all kept leaping over the shoulders of their fathers.  A little Prince of Finland leaped over the King\u2019s shoulders 150 times.  Then there was a ball, and at dawn the bride and bridegroom slept together again.  \u201cBut how do they sleep,\u201d asked the old Fairy who gave away the Princess, \u201cwhen the rest of the world is awake?\u201d  She went into the Queen\u2019s bed-chamber, and saw that she did not sleep all night long, and that there was a cold wind in her heart.  These were very severe weather signs, which showed that it was going to be an uncertain season.\nThe next day the Court returned to the Town and the King to his duties.  The Prince and Princess sat at home alone.  They had each two little pets, a black and a white cat.  Sometimes they played with them, but not always.  One afternoon they went out for a walk, and the King and Queen had not been away for four months.\nThey saw a great flock of snow-white doves.  \u201cGoodness,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cyou are too pretty to die!\u201d ", "prompt": "<s>THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.

Then they all walked out on the Terrace, where the air was soft and sweet, and the stars shone down, and shone through the clear radiance of the cold Northern Lights.  Afterwards there were dancing, and the Princess danced with her husband a little polka under the pink palm trees.\nBut soon the time came for them to part.  The Princess had to go back to her land; she was tired and sad, for her lover was so beautiful, but he was not of her country.  He had said that if ever they parted he would come and marry her.  \u201cI shall wait for you till I die!\u201d she cried; and the Prince answered, \u201cI will come!\u201d\nFrom the top floor of a great, great staircase she watched him drive away.  How many lovers watched by a deserted tomb at midnight!  So she watched by one still left bright with the sun of earth, watching the glow deepen and deepen, until a great crimson shadow fell upon the glittering grains, and the sky beyond grew pale, and pale, as the shadow crept lower and lower upon the moon that had sunk in the sea.\nThen the old King\u2019s eyes grew dim.  When he looked out of his windows into the long, strange Winter nights he thought of his son\u2019s bride.  How far away she was!

How pale she had looked here in her bridal-gown of pearls and gold!\nBut her Prince had come, and he was not pale.  He was fairer and mightier, brighter and fresher than ever.  Nobody was happier than he.\nYet he dreamt of his Princess with such wistful dreams that they were sadder than sad.  The cold Northern Lights shone for ever in his eyes.

And as there were no\npeople in the palace, all was so still in the great square, that any one\nmight hear a pin fall. There was not even at a window in the whole house\nany person with a kind word, or any woman to make the Queen's bed, or to\nplace anything in her room, or to lay the table, or to put the royal\nbed in order on arising.\nBut there was a Dwarf in the palace.

In telling of their\nhearts they had to relate how they lost first their children, their\nonly sons, who had eaten the fruit of the poisonous tree, and\nsubsequently their husbands, who took it into their heads to try the\nfruit of the poisonous tree a second time, for it is very disagreeable\nto have your husband's and children's hearts broken at once; a circumstance\nthat shows that the two fair ladies were very brave, and had real love\nfor those they had lost, for all the world besides.\n\"It is lucky in such sad circumstances,\" said the Queen, \"that we have\nthis sofa.
