[{"id": 0, "text": "When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. \n\nOne of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. \n\n\nShe was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. \n\nSometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. \n\n\nAs the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. \n\nShe would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. \n\n\nThe rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn't sure how to go about it. \n\nShe started to rock back and forth.\n\nThen she started to spin. \n\nSoon enough, she was flying through the sky. \n\nAs she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry there is a rain storm. \n\n\nAt first the rock was not good at moving. She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. \n\n\nShe saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.\n\n\nThen found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.\n\n\nShe swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.\n\n\nAnd then she saw a planet that was, well\u2026 she wasn\u2019t sure. \n\n\nOne planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.\n\n\nAnother one was very shy, not fond of being seen.\n\n\nShe flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.\n\n\nAnd then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!\n\n\nShe had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. \n\nThey were all so different and all so pretty. \n\nIt became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. \n\nSo she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. \n\nEventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. \n\n\nThis made her stop for a moment. \n\n\u201cI do not know where I should go next\u201d she said out loud. \u201cEach direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe big blue planet overheard this. \u201cCan you not see why I am brighter?\" it asked.\n\n\n\n\"You are the brightest planet I have ever seen,\" she said, \"but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have brightened me,\u201d it said. \n\n\n\n\u201cBut I am just a rock\u201d she replied. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,\u201d said the big blue planet. \u201cYou have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine.  And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. \n\n\n\nSo the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered. \n\n\n\n \"Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe thought, until she knew exactly what to do.", "title": "THE STELLAR ONE\n"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Chapter One: Sarglop\u2019s Thick & Slurpy Ramen Noodles\n\nIt happened in an instant. \n\nTo be precise, it happened in somewhere between a picosecond and a second. If you had tried to say the words \u201cSarglop\u2019s Ramen Noodles\u201d in the time it took to happen, it would be over before you finished taking the little breath that humans take before they start speaking. Not even the \u201cs\u201d from \u201cSarglop\u2019s\u201d would be heard, and anyone wondering what you were going to say would be left with no choice but to guess. Even if, by some cosmic coincidence, they guessed that you had been about to say the name of a noodle, they would have almost no chance of knowing which one, and would probably guess a less thick and less slurpy noodle than Sarglop\u2019s.\n\nSo, to tell you about it slowly would be inappropriate, given the shocking speed at which it occurred. \n\nIn fact, Aggomalda\u2019s Universal Ratio, which states that the length of a story may not exceed ten times the length of the event it is describing, dictates that there can be no build up at all. Therefore, at this moment, I can\u2019t tell you why a personal assistant was in space. I cannot even explain how he came to be eating a tuna fish sandwich that wasn\u2019t meant for him.\n\nI know you\u2019re used to being told a great many things in books, written in long sentences with many details, but it simply wouldn\u2019t be right, given how quickly it happened, to say anything but this:\n\nOne moment Jackson Fickle was taking the second bite of a tuna fish sandwich, and the next he was pulled inside a black hole. \n\nOf course, it\u2019s true that I could go back and tell you more about him now, having described the speedy event speedily, but I think you will find that when black holes are involved, the best way backwards is forwards. And as you now know, a black hole is exactly where Jackson found himself after just one-and-a-half bites of someone else's tuna fish sandwich.\n\nHe was still chewing when he noticed that his ROC (Roving Observational Craft) was now somewhere that neither he, nor I, can describe to you. And it is important to note that while I chose not to describe Jackson and how he got here in the first place, I am not now choosing to not describe his black hole (which would one day be named \u2018Jackson Hole\u2019 after him) because I do not wish to do so, but because it cannot be described. Black holes are, in fact, impossible to describe. The official Universal University of the Universe\u2019s list of things that cannot be described is exactly five items long, and blacks holes are number two on that list. *At the time of this writing, a sixth item, the feeling of having an oncoming sneeze interrupted, is being considered for the list, but has not yet been accepted.\n\nSo, to try to describe what Jackson saw and felt inside the black hole would be a waste of time. Instead, I can only share with you the one thing that Jackson remembers clearly about the experience and insists upon to this day: when he came out the other side he had the taste of peppermint in his mouth. And, given that he had been eating a tuna fish sandwich, which is on the opposite side of the UU of U\u2019s spectrum of tastes, you can imagine the drastic nature of his short journey. \n\nWhen he arrived safely through the black hole, Jackson, who had yet to say a single word since the time that you learned of his existence, continued to say nothing. If he did speak you could assume that at this time he would have said something peppermint related, but assumptions have a way of getting you into trouble, as you will learn in Chapter 12 (a chapter whose noodles are paper thin, and can hardly be slurped at all). \n\n Chapter Two: Argall\u2019s Unbreakable Fogelmite Locks\n\nJackson Fickle was unsure what to do. \n\nHis three years of service as the Personal Assistant to the Non-Personal Assistant to the Executive Assistant to the President of Earth had not prepared him for this situation. It had only prepared him for scheduling trips and ordering light food and beverages, neither of which applied here. Still, he had always considered himself lucky to have landed the job at all, since he is overwhelming uncomfortable with being interviewed, and sweats through his underclothes, overclothes, and any accessories he may be wearing. It just so happened that his interview with the Non-Personal Assistant to the Executive Assistant to the President was on a cold January morning, and the heat in the White House\u2019s West Wing had stopped working. The frigid winter air prevented him from sweating through his outermost layer, a winter parka with a fur-lined hood.\n\nGiven his lack of relevant experience, Jackson decided to sit back and watch as his ROC was pulled through the enormous metal teeth of the Byzong Warship\u2019s landing bay. Often times in his young life, Jackson had found that when he was confused, outmatched, or otherwise at a disadvantage, the best course of action was no action at all. He found that this worked most of the time (if he had been trained in data evaluation he would had found that it worked exactly 89.9% of the time, but the Personal Assistant to a Non-Personal Assistant to an Executive Assistant is not often trained in data evaluation) whereas, attempting a bold action worked much less frequently (24.59% of the time, in fact), as he had learned, in part, when standing up to his elementary school bully, Arn Brule, in defense of a young girl by the name of Marlet. But,\n\n you need not remember their names for another fourteen chapters. \n\nAs the cable drew the ROC to rest into the landing bay, Jackson stood fast to his plan of doing nothing. When the Byzong Ship Attendant came to the door and asked Jackson to open it, he did not move. When two more Byzong crew members knocked on the windows and motioned for him to turn the latch and open up, he neither spoke nor shook his head. He did absolutely nothing. For the entire ten minutes that it took them to pry open the door, Jackson did hardly more than blink. By the time they pulled him out and stood him up before the Boss of Ships, everyone in the entire landing bay was angry, except Jackson.\n\nThe Ship Attendant handed the Boss of Ships the remainder of the tuna fish sandwich and nodded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful jumpsuit you\u2019re wearing. Why didn\u2019t you open up and let my crew aboard?!\u2019 the Boss asked.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to do. So, I did nothing.\u201d Jackson replied, in the pleasant, yet slightly shaky voice that you did not know he had until this moment.\n\n\u201cBrilliant shoes,\u201d said the Ship Attendant. \u201cYou know you could have saved us a whole lot of time if you had just opened up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s happened. Can you tell me\u2026 where am I?\u201d\n\nThe Boss of Ships paced in front of Jackson with a scowl.\n\n\u201cFirst you delay our mission, and now you refuse to compliment us? You must be the worst prisoner we\u2019ve ever had!\u201d \n\n\u201cPrisoner?\u201d Jackson repeated in disbelief. Suddenly he remembered his Year 8 course of Intergalactic Species, in which he had done exceptionally well. He had learned that Byzongs used to be considered one of the most advanced civilizations in the universe until their former leader made a series of poor and increasingly ill-advised wagers with their planet\u2019s fortunes. Jackson seemed to remember that at a certain point the leader, Supreme Chancellor Plaggis, had become so desperate to win back his losses, that he bet the Jargons that he could tunnel through the center of his planet and come out the other side. Given the astronomical odds against him, it was calculated that winning the bet would have made him the richest person in the universe. Unfortunately for the Byzongs, he disappeared below ground with little more than a motorized shovel and was never heard from again. The Byzongs lost not just their leader, but 80% of their wealth and resources, and have been struggling to recover ever since. He also recalled that Byzong culture demanded that each conversation begin with a compliment from both parties. No exceptions. Jackson sought to fix his mistake immediately.\n\n\u201cWhat I mean to say\u2026\u201d he corrected. \u201cIs that this is very impressive for a Byzong ship.\u201d\n\nThe Boss of Ships scowled at Jackson with crossed arms. \u201cTake him to the Inquisition Pyramid\u201d.\n\nJackson had taken another Year 8 course named \u201cMethods & Manners\u201d, in which he did exceptionally poorly. Had he done moderately poorly, or even surprisingly poorly instead, he would have recognized that his compliment was what is traditionally considered \u201cbackhanded\u201d (meaning not much of a compliment at all). And Byzongs, experienced in these kinds of things, do not take kindly to backhanded compliments. \n\nTwo guards strode forward and grabbed Jackson by the arms. \n\n\u201cExcellent physique. Now come with us,\u201d they said in unison, throwing on a pair of handcuffs. As they dragged him away, there was little chance of escape, since these handcuffs had been outfitted with an Argall Unbreakable Fogelmite lock, built to last for a thousand years, and special ordered for this occasion by the Byzong general herself. After the click of his well-crafted handcuffs, Jackson heard only the loud clanging of the guards\u2019 boots escorting him down a long hall. \n\nHad he thought more about it, Jackson might have wanted to look around and glean whatever he could about the ship and the crew as he was led through the hull of the ship. He heard Byzongs hurrying along on either side into rooms whose uses he could hardly fathom. And if he had looked up, just five seconds after leaving the loading bay, he would have had a clear view into a sunken room filled with the finest Byzong scientists of their generation. He would have seen the hologram of a large machine pointed at a model of Earth, and he may have understood, to some degree, the gravity of his situation. Instead, committed to his plan of doing nothing, Jackson didn\u2019t look up at all.\n\n Chapter Three: X-RING Glasses\n\n           Jackson was ushered into a white room with blue stripes that was in the shape of a pyramid. It was the first time he had ever sat in a pyramid-shaped room, he reasoned. Almost every room he\u2019d ever set foot in had four walls, one ceiling, and one floor. The only exception was the morning that he delivered a cup of coffee to the President of Earth in the Oval Office. She had ordered it with \u201ccow\u2019s milk\u201d, eight sugars, and three drops of vanilla. That she had asked for the milk to be \u201ccow\u2019s milk\u201d had always stood out to him, just like the shape of his current interrogation room. \n\nThe guards sat him a chair that was surprisingly comfortable and he could not help but thank them as they took off his handcuffs. \n\nThe two guards stood behind him for three minutes, wondering if they should offer him a drink. After twenty seconds each guard assumed that if it were appropriate to offer him a drink, surely the other guard would have by then, and so Jackson was not offered a drink.\n\nJackson, satisfied that his plan of doing nothing had been successful in some way, turned around slightly to view the guards. He had never encountered a Byzong in person before and, having encountered a good many in a short period of time, he allowed himself to marvel slightly at their appearance. Byzongs look like humans in every way except for the many ways in which they do not. They are generally muscular in nature, particularly in the calves and forearms. They have noses just one third the size of the average human, and their ears are a foot tall. Their feet, as it happens, are only a human ear long, but they make up for it with special-made metal boots that clunk and clonk as they walk. It is a point of great pride for a Byzong to have loud footsteps, and the Byzong with the loudest footsteps in the room is often considered the most important and well-respected. The competition makes social gatherings unbearably loud, and dance parties illegal.\n\nNoticing him staring at them, the guards became uncomfortable, wondering if they were being judged for not having offered him a drink. Noticing instead their level of discomfort, Jackson turned back around, feeling uncomfortable with how he\u2019d made his captors feel. So it was that all occupants in the pyramid room felt shame and discomfort but none for an appropriate reason. \n\nJackson, who was now busying himself by looking around the pyramid room, saw that each of the three walls had exactly one door. The door he had come through was behind him. So, he was facing two doors, angled towards him from both his right and left. The left door opened first. \n\nAs she entered, the footsteps of Inquisitor Slah were the loudest that Jackson had ever heard. He was more thankful than ever to not be handcuffed as he covered his ears. The guards, whose ears were much larger than Jackson\u2019s, had little hope of covering their own, and would anyway not have risked the humiliation. Any indication that the Inquisitor\u2019s boots were too loud for them would make it clear to any Byzong that they themselves do not have boots as loud as hers, and they do not often socialize with Byzongs with boots of her decibel level. \n\nMercifully, Inquisitor Slah quickly made her way to the table in front of Jackson and sat down. She looked him up and down through a pair of sharp X-Ring Lie-Detector Glasses, designed to give the wearer the ability to see the truth of a statement as clear as the tiny nose on their face. \n\n\u201cWonderful posture. I am Inquisitor Slah. I imagine you have some questions. I will allow you three,\u201d she said.\n\nJackson raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe Inquisitor smirked. \n\n\u201cYou are here because we kidnapped you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, why did you kidnap me?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cBecause we plan on taking all the water from Earth and you have information that we need.\u201d\n\nJackson was shocked. He didn\u2019t understand why anyone would want to steal something so important from his planet. So large. So liquid. He didn\u2019t understand what he had to do with such a plan. But more importantly at that moment, he could not understand how something so bold and ambitious could be done. And unfortunately for him, it was that curiosity that informed his third question.\n\n\u201cHow do you plan on doing that?!\u201d he asked loudly.\n\n\u201cBy using a Third Generation Macro-Electro-Bionic-Hydroxy-Gravitational Tube Ray,\u201d she said confidently.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s a\u2026\u201d Jackson started to ask another question but the Inquisitor raised her finger in protest.\n\n\u201cThree questions. Three Answers, President Racha.\u201d \n\nJackson furrowed his brow.\n\n\u201cDid you just call me\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor slammed her boot into the ground and Jackson covered his ears once more.\n\n\u201cAh, ah, ah,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cNo more questions.\u201d\n\nJackson nodded slowly as he lowered his hands.\n\n\u201cNow it is my turn to ask the questions. We will have, an interview of sorts. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to those, being President of such a big important planet as Earth.\u201d The Inquisitor let out a little chuckle at her comment. Jackson thought he could hear chuckles from the guards behind him but he couldn\u2019t be sure with his ears still recovering from boots of such stature. \n\nBut he had heard, distinctly, the word \u2018interview\u2019, and this set off an involuntary, psychosomatic, pituitary reaction in Jackson that he knew all too well. Sweat began to bead down the back of his neck.\n\n\u201cFirst question,\u201d she started, \u201cHow are your oceans protected? Which oceans are easiest to steal, and which are most heavily defended?\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s sweat began to bead on his freckled forehead. \n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how an ocean can be stolen. We don\u2019t have anything protecting them.\u201d\n\nInquisitor Slah\u2019s X-RING glasses zoomed in on a perfectly formed drop of sweat on Jackson\u2019s forehead and logged it. It played Jackson\u2019s answer back three times internally, using X-RING patented lie-detector technology, and noted his slightly shaky voice. These factors combined caused the rim of the glasses to flash orange, the interplanetary color of deceit. \n\nThe Inquisitor narrowed her eyes. \n\n\u201cYou lie! So your oceans are well protected, then? No matter, we are prepared to destroy any defenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroy?\u201d Jackson said with concern, trying hard not to say anything that would be considered a question.\n\n\u201cI think there is a misunderstanding. I am not an expert on any defenses at all! I\u2019m just the Personal Assistant to the Non-Personal Assistant to the Executive Assistant to the President!\u201d\n\nSweat ran down the sides of his face and the X-RING Glasses flashed orange again. \n\n\u201cLies! Fibs!\u201d she shouted. Besides the excessively loud stomps that her position afforded her, calling out the fibs of fibbers was the Inquisitor\u2019s favorite part of the job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fibbing! How can you not know what the President\u2026\u201d Jackson caught himself and corrected. \u201cI would think, that if you planned on kidnapping a President, you would know what they looked like first.\u201d\n\nHe nodded contentedly at his strategy.\n\nInquisitor Slah waved him off.\n\n\u201cWe do not rely on such frivolous things as appearances. They can be changed easily. Instead we rely on names, which in Byzong culture, can never be changed.\u201d \n\n\u201cOn Earth, names can be changed easily,\u201d he retorted. The sweat stains had begun to seep through his light blue shirt, and the X-RING glasses once more happily tattled on him on for lying.\n\n\u201cI see by your lies that it is much the same in your culture,\u201d she smiled. \n\n\u201cBut my name isn\u2019t President Racha, it\u2019s Jackson Fickle!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur spy has been on your staff for some time, tracking your whereabouts and gathering information. We knew that you would be passing by the Portus Black Hole at lunchtime today. So, he simply placed a tracker in your tuna fish sandwich\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cInside the sandwich\u2026,\u201d he whispered in thought.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. And once we isolated your location, we simply harpooned your vessel and pulled you through to our location,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cIt really couldn\u2019t have gone better.\u201d\n\nThe guards behind him smiled at each other.\n\nJackson sighed and put his head down. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was supposed to eat that sandwich,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Inquisitor looked at him curiously. Her glasses scanned him feverishly but did not flash.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI thought it was meant for me. But now I\u2019m thinking that I made a big mistake\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d she encouraged.\n\n\u201cThe sandwich baggie had the initials \u2019T.F.\u2019 on it, which must have stood for tuna fish. I thought it stood for my name.\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor scowled.\n\n\u201cYou just claimed your name was Jackson Fickle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is. But my real name is Theodore Fickle. But I prefer my middle name\u2026 Jackson.\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor leaned back in her chair and let out a long breath.\n\n\u201cAh, this changing names business again. I don\u2019t need glasses to tell me that\u2019s a fib.\u201d\n\nBefore Jackson could say another word, an alarm went off inside the warship. The sound was a high-pitched rhythmic ringing and he couldn\u2019t help but think that it sounded similar to a giant triangle being played by an aggressive percussionist. The guards looked at each other and then at the Inquisitor. \n\nThe guards wondered if they should leave and see why the alarm was going off. But, since the other guard hadn\u2019t moved, each guard assumed that they were doing the right thing by standing still. It was in this way the guards ignored the alarm and stared at the Inquisitor while the alarm rang loudly throughout the room. \n\nThe Inquisitor was about to yell at one of them for not checking on the alarm (she was still deciding on which one to yell at), when a Byzong cadet opened the other door across from Jackson and ran over to the Inquisitor. \n\n\u201cYou have a very strong jawline. The Admiral would like to see you on the bridge,\u201d he said, while standing at attention.\n\n\u201cYou have exquisite taste in jawlines,\u201d she complimented. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of an interrogation! What do they want with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe received a signal from inside the Jaggidal Asteroid Belt. A Vlop cruiser is threatening to fire on us,\u201d they answered. \n\n\u201cThe Vlops are our allies. Why would they want to fire on us?\u201d Inquisitor Slah was not in the mood for a cadet prank. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the Admiral asked!\u201d he answered excitedly. \u201cAnd they said they\u2019ve had a really bad day and they\u2019re just in the mood.\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor looked away in thought. \u201cThey are a temperamental bunch.\u201d She turned back to the cadet. \u201cBut what does this have to do with me?? I\u2019m an Inquisitor, not a Negotiator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said the only way they\u2019ll consider not firing is if they speak to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe cadet nodded. \n\n\u201cBut why me? I haven\u2019t even spoken to a Vlop since UU of U,\u201d she mused.\n\n\u201cNo one knows,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut the Admiral is freaking out and asked me to get you right away.\u201d He leaned in to whisper. \u201cWe can\u2019t seem to find their ship anywhere on our radar. It must be their most advanced vessel yet. Undetectable.\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor thought for a moment, then stood up. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not finished,\u201d she said to Jackson.\n\nThe cadet led her out of the room swiftly, and closed the door behind them. \n\nJackson hardly had time to watch it close, when the other door across from him opened again. A young Byzong woman stepped in and pulled aside the Inquisitor\u2019s chair. \n\n\u201cWhat lovely scowls you have. My name is Tarza and I\u2019m here to check on the prisoner\u2019s health. Is this him?\u201d she asked, pointing to Jackson.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful,\u201d said one guard. \u201cThis is the Presidential prisoner,\u201d he corrected proudly.\n\nTarza smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nShe looked Jackson over with narrowed eyes, and made a \u201ctsk\u201d sound. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it! This prisoner\u2026\u201d she started. \n\n\u201cPresidential prisoner,\u201d the guard added again. \n\n\u201cPresidential prisoner,\u201d she corrected, \u201cis clearly suffering from a Form C Phantom Level face rash!\u201d\n\nThe guards came around to her side of the table and stared at Jackson intently.\n\n\u201cHe is?\u201d asked the guard. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t! It\u2019s a Phantom Level infection. Invisible to the naked eye, but has a very distinct feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 you didn\u2019t touch his face.\u201d said the guard.\n\n\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t! Do you know how contagious a Form C Phantom Level face rash is?!\u201d\n\nThe two guards took one step back. \n\n\u201cHe needs to get to the medical station where we can properly treat him. He\u2019ll need to isolate immediately. I\u2019ll take him since I know the proper precautions, and you clearly don\u2019t. Have you even sprayed yourself with nasal protection?\u201d she asked, incredulous.\n\nThe guards quickly covered their noses with their hands.\n\n\u201cI knew it! You\u2019re lucky your noses haven\u2019t fallen off yet,\u201d Tarza shouted as she helped Jackson up from his chair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going now,\u201d she said as she ushered Jackson towards the door she came from.\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, said one of the guards, through the hands covering his mouth. \u201cThe Inquisitor has more questions for him\u2026\u201d\n\nTarza pushed Jackson through the door, not stopping or turning around to address them. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll just have to wait. He shouldn\u2019t be around anyone for at least\u2026 24\u2026 48 hours!\n\nThe guards were not sure if they should allow their Presidential prisoner to leave the room or not. They were each fairly certain that the Inquisitor would be upset if she learned that he had left. However, they also assumed that if him leaving was truly a problem, then the other guard would have stopped them before they left. And since both of them believed this to be true, neither of them said a word. And this was how it came to be that the door shut with Tarza and Jackson on one side, and the guards on the other. \n\nChapter Four: The Amazing Warp-Port Challenge \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not sick. I\u2019m going to get you out of here,\u201d assured Tarza in a whisper.\n\nWithout saying another word, she rushed Jackson through one narrow hall after the other. Whenever she heard someone coming, she made them change course. Finally, just as Jackson was getting a little winded from the rushing, they came to a blue-lit room and stepped inside. Jackson saw that it had a control station and a large window facing out into space. Tarza shut the door and turned a knob on the wall until the door turned yellow.\n\n\u201cThere. That should give us some privacy,\u201d she said in relief. \n\n\u201cWhy did it turn yellow?\u201d Jackson asked.\n\n\u201cIt means someone inside is doing accounting,\u201d she answered. \u201cA red door means \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019, but Byzongs tend to eavesdrop on red doors. They think something interesting must be going on inside. No one sits outside a yellow door.\u201d\n\nJackson nodded. \n\nTarza approached him with an intense curiosity.\n\n\u201cWhy is it,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat you haven\u2019t tried to run from me or ask me any questions yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked about the door,\u201d he corrected. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. You know now that I lied to the guards about who I was and where I\u2019m taking you, and yet you haven\u2019t tried to figure out who I am and where I\u2019m taking you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a policy on circumstances such as these,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of policy?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 if I find myself confused, then I do nothing. Statistically, it\u2019s smarter and safer to do nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019re confused?\u201d she asked with a cocked eyebrow.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do absolutely nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d stated Tarza.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is,\u201d he retorted. \n\n\u201cImagine if the whole universe followed your silly rule. If kids just stopped doing anything every time they got confused. They\u2019d never learn a thing! Imagine if captains stopped giving orders anytime something new and strange happened\u2026\u201d\n\nJackson went to open his mouth but stopped.\n\n\u201c\u2026Imagine if all the greatest thinkers, from all the planets in the universe just stopped doing things whenever they came across a confusing problem.\u201d she ended.\n\nAt first Jackson felt taken aback. Then he decided this may be considered an affront. And then he wondered why there was no such thing as \u2018amiddle\u2019, but let it go as quickly as it came, for the aside that it was.\n\n\u201cI see your point,\u2019 said Jackson. \n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re agreed. As President of Earth you should end this policy of yours immediately,\u201d she answered.\n\nJackson nodded, which made Tarza smile.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cExcept I\u2019m not President of Earth.\u201d\n\nTarza stopped smiling.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Did you change your title? Ruler of Earth? Supreme Titan of Earth?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m none of those things. The President is still on her ship, and I\u2019m not her.\u201d he answered. \n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Tarza looked down shaking her head. \u201cHow is that possible? They\u2019ve been planning the kidnapping for so long.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is time for me to ask some questions of my own. Who are you, and why is that you\u2019re trying to save me, err, I mean the President, if the rest of the Byzongs want to kidnap me, um, her,\u201d Jackson asked, feeling more bold than usual.\n\nTarza was still in shock but managed to form the words.\n\n\u201cMy name is Tarza, that part is true. And I do work on this warship. But for the last four years  I\u2019ve been a member of a secret intra-planetary network of elite agents named The Pocket Watches. And right now our job is to stop this Byzong plan to take all of Earth\u2019s water. If they succeed, the consequences will be much worse than you could possible imagine.\u201d she said with a grave face.\n\n\u201cSo they really want to take all of Earth\u2019s water?? I still don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s even possible!\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a Third Generation Macro-Electro-Bionic-Hydroxy-Gravitational Tube Ray,\u201d she said cooly. \u201cAnything past First Generation would do the trick, honestly.\u201d\n\nJackson sighed. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your plan to get me out of here then?\u201d\n\nTarza put her hand to her chin and eyed Jackson.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan was designed for me to get President Racha out of here. And you\u2019re saying you\u2019re an entirely different human than her?\u201d she asked sincerely.\n\n\u201cRight. My name is Jackson.\u201d\n\n\u201cJackson,\u201d she mirrored. \u201cBut you were on the President\u2019s ship, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cSpace Force One.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo are you in charge of Earth\u2019s defenses? Does the President listen you on important matters? If we get you out of here, can you help us reach the President?\u201d she asked.\n\nJackson believed strongly in the value of honesty. It is a trait that earned him the superlative \u201cMost Honest\u201d in his high school yearbook. That the title was meant as an insult because Jackson frequently told on classmates that he saw skipping school was not an important detail to the story when he repeated it in his interview for the role of Personal Assistant to the Non-Personal Assistant to the Executive Assistant to the President- a role that does not put him in charge of Earth\u2019s defenses, or allow him to broach important matters with the President. And on this day, he decided the best way to honor the tile of \u2018Most Honest\u2019, regardless of its origins, while still securing his chances of rescue from the Byzong warship by the secret intra-planetary network of elite agents named The Pocket Watches, was to answer only the last of Tarza\u2019s questions, without clarifying that he was not answering on behalf of all the questions he was just asked. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\nTarza smiled in solace.\n\n\u201cThen I think the Pocket Watches will be happy to meet you. All we\u2019ve got to do is warp-port over to them and they\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarp-port? What\u2019s that? Is that like teleporting?\u201d Jackson asked.\n\n\u201cTeleporting?! Teleporting isn\u2019t even real. That\u2019s something a child would say! Have you really never heard of warp-porting before?\u201d\n\nJackson shook his head.\n\n\u201cWhat about The Amazing Warp-Port Challenge? You\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never seen a single episode?\u201d she asked.\n\nJackson shook his head in silence. He could have mentioned how expensive XDI Visions with Cross-Universe service are for someone in his position, but then he remembered that he did not want Tarza knowing much more, if anything at all, about his position. If he had seen The Amazing Warp-Port Challenge (new episodes available every Earth Thursday on the Nebula Channel), then he would have known it is the premiere reality series of the millennia, and that Warp-Porting is a fun way to travel great distances in mere seconds, using dimensional slingshot technology. But since he hadn\u2019t seen it, which many would say was punishment enough, he also had to endure the judgmental glare of Tarza.\n\n\u201cAll you need to know is that I\u2019m getting us out of here. And just in time, too. Once they realize what I\u2019ve done they\u2019ll come looking for both of us.\u201d\n\nTarza pulled out a small disc and handed it to Jackson.\n\n\u201cThis is your port-pod for warping,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cMy warp-port port-pod?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo one calls them that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNow, when I say so, I want you to push the green button and initiate the sequence. Everything\u2019s already been input for departure.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Jackson as he looked around.\n\nTarza pulled out her own port-pod and readied herself. \n\n\u201cNow you might feel a slight pinch on your ears. And a slight burning on your cheeks. And a slight severe pain in your head. But that\u2019s all normal.\u201d she hurriedly added.\n\n\u201cThat sounds a bit\u2026\u201d Jackson started.\n\nTarza raised her hand to shush him. She heard footsteps down the hall approaching their door.\n\nShe turned to Jackson with a panicked look.\n\n\u201cNow! Push the green button now!\u201d she shouted.\n\nJackson turned around and pressed a flashing green button on the control panel next to him. \n\nTarza\u2019s eyes went wide. She wanted to scream at him for his mistake. For never turning over his disc and seeing the small green button on the other side. She wanted to chastise him for assuming she had meant for him to push a green button that was clearly part of the ship itself, instead of a button on the port-pod that he had just been handed. She wanted to tell him how angry she was that he just pushed the first flashing green button he saw. But she couldn\u2019t get a single syllable out of her mouth before the blue-lit room was filled with a porous, white foam that froze her in place.\n\n Chapter Five: Fellswig Robot Slippers\n\n                    Jackson Fickle was in the 98th percentile of dream-rememberers. Most mornings, Jackson was able to recall his previous night\u2019s dream. From the age of seven onward, he had experienced at least 4 recurring dreams (recurring being defined as a dream that has been repeated at least twice). The first took place in a jungle, and involved Jackson\u2019s family needing to be saved from a wild tiger. In the second, Jackson lived in a clear hamster ball the size of a house, but his roommates did not resemble anyone from his real life. The third recurring dream took place under the ocean, where Jackson found he had no problem breathing, but did have a problem with a group of angry merpeople. The last and most recurring, involved Jackson sitting in a pitch black room where only another set of eyes are visible. This is the dream Jackson likes to speak about the least.\n\nBut as Jackson regained consciousness and opened his eyes next to a still sleeping, Tarza, he could not remember a single dream. He could not remember why he had fallen asleep in the first place. And he could not remember where he was. It was the Boss of Ships, and their muffled voice, that reminded him of his situation. \n\n\u201cIs he awake yet?\u201d asked the Boss.\n\n\u201cLooks like he\u2019s coming to right now,\u201d said an assistant. \n\nJackson could barley make out the shapes and faces of the speakers through the hard hazy foam that encased him. He tried moving his right hand, then his left. When neither budged, he tried moving his right leg, then his left. In a rather desperate attempt to feel some sense of freedom, Jackson tried to wiggle his ears, but then remembered that he had never been able to do that.\n\n\u201cLet me talk to him,\u201d said the Boss.\n\nThe assistant raised a glowing mechanical wand towards Jackson. He watched as the tool turned the foam around him a dull orange. It receded rapidly until Jackson\u2019s head and right shoulder were uncovered. \n\nJackson shook his head from left to right, happy to once again be able to move and wiggle whatever he liked, excluded his ears, whose lack of mobility could not be blamed on anything other than genetics. Jackson, having been around Byzongs for a small but significant amount of time now, and being adept at assimilating into new cultural circumstances (a trait of his that you may not have been aware of until this moment) asked the Boss of Ships a question, using the proper Byzong etiquette. \n\n\u201cWonderful ship you have here! May I please be let go?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe Boss of Ships gave an approving smile. \n\n\u201cYou have excellent manners for a prisoner. No, you may not,\u201d he responded.\n\nJackson began to smack his lips involuntarily.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that last in my mouth? Is that foam strawberry flavored?\u201d he asked, still smacking.\n\nAn assistant with ears so long that they flopped down behind her head, stepped forward with a soft clang and a smile.\n\n\u201cExcellent observational skills. That is the flavoring that I added to make the experience more pleasant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t like it one bit,\u201d said Jackson candidly. \u201cI\u2019d prefer chocolate.\u201d\n\nThe Boss puffed his chest out.\n\n\u201cHow dare you question Maartosh! She is a galaxy-renowned flavorologist. She decided the taste of everything on this ship!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must mean \u2018every bit of food on this ship,\u2019\u201d Jackson corrected.\n\n\u201cNo, I mean everything on this ship,\u201d the Boss replied.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 not everything has a taste,\u201d Jackson retorted.\n\nThe Boss scoffed. \u201cSolarwind! Name one thing that doesn\u2019t have a taste!\u201d\n\nJackson was flabbergasted. Surely, The Boss wasn\u2019t serious. He looked around.\n\n\u201cThe floor. The floor doesn\u2019t have a taste,\u201d said Jackson proudly.\n\n\u201cIt certainly does. It tastes of bitter metal,\u201d said Maartosh. \u201cI made sure of it.\u201d\n\nJackson shook his head. \n\n\u201cNo, but, that\u2019s not a taste like a taste that you would enjoy, that\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAh ha!\u201d shouted The Boss. \u201cYou are confusing taste with good taste! Of course everything has a taste to it, they\u2019re just not all to your liking. Imagine if everything tasted sweet and wonderful. No one would get anything done!\u201d\n\nMaartosh nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re be licking everything, all the time. That\u2019s why I make sure that the things that shouldn\u2019t taste good, don\u2019t taste good.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 but, you don\u2019t need to do anything to make a floor taste bad. It tastes bad already!\u201d said Jackson.\n\n\u201cAh ha again!\u201d said the Boss. \u201cA moment ago, you said it didn\u2019t have a taste.\u201d\n\nJackson was about to shout something back, until he realized that the Boss had a point. \n\nAs he often did when he had nothing more clever to say, he tried to change the subject.\n\nHe looked over at Tarza, still frozen in foam.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to leave me stuck here, could you at least let Tarza join us?\u201d \n\nThe Boss of Ships stomped his excessively loud boot. \n\n\u201cYou mean your co-conspirator??\u201d he howled. \n\n\u201cCo-conspirator? I just met her a few moments ago,\u201d Jackson defended. \n\nThe Boss gave a cocky smile.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been set in our Intruder Immobilizer foam for three hours, so I highly doubt that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThree hours?!\u201d Jackson said with alarm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to her out of there, now!\u201d \n\nThe Boss sighed.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s perfectly fine. The foam allows all necessary functions while providing essential nutrients. We\u2019ve been monitoring you both the entire time. After all, you are of great importance to us, President Racha.\u201d\n\nThe Boss nodded again to the assistant. \n\n\u201cNevertheless.\u201d\n\nThe assistant moved their foam-melting wand around Tarza\u2019s until she was free to move her head. Almost immediately, she started to rouse.\n\nJackson breathed a sigh of relief, then turned his attention back to the Boss.\n\n\u201cThank you. But stop calling me President Racha!\u201d he insisted.\n\nThe Boss grabbed a tablet from another assistant and reviewed the information beaming from its surface. As Jackson had already learned, Byzongs place a good deal of importance on names, and the Boss was embarrassed at the potential blunder.\n\n\u201cHow is it that you pronounce it, then? Earth names are all so odd-sounding to me,\u201d he said sincerely. \n\nJackson shook his head. \n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cCharming belly you have!\u201d interrupted Tarza, still groggy from the foam. \u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to say is that his title is President Supreme and Ultimate Ruler of the Earth, Racha, The One and Only.\u201d\n\nThe Boss gave a demonstrative bow.\n\n\u201cAh, yes, sorry to have been so disrespectful,\u201d he said with a chuckle. The assistants behind him joined in as well. \n\nJackson looked at Tarza in shock. He could not understand why Tarza had lied. He had just told her hours-that-felt-like-moments ago that he was not in fact, President Racha. And he was equally in shock that she knew the full title that President Racha had given herself in an oft-ignored executive order meant to \u201cjazz up the office a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon us your Supremeness, but we\u2019re going to go get Inquisitor Slah,\u201d said the Boss. \u201cI understand she never finished interviewing you.\u201d \n\nThe Boss walked up to Tarza and stared her right in the eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd I imagine she may have some questions for you as well.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing the word \u201cinterview\u201d, Jackson again began to sweat profusely again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving you in the care of two of our most advanced ROBs, Prod and Dusty,\u201d the Boss continued.\n\nJackson whispered to Tarza, \u201c\u2018ROBs\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cShort for robots,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cWhat do you call them on Earth?\u201d\n\n\u201cBots,\u201d he answered. \n\n\u201cHow odd,\u201d she said.\n\nProd and Dusty, walked into the room just as the Boss and the assistants left.Their footsteps were practically inaudible, given that each was wearing a pair of bright yellow Fellswig Robot Slippers, designed to make sure that no robot, no matter how large and no matter how heavy, makes more noise than you with their metal feet. \n\n\u201cHey, Prod. Hey, Dusty,\u201d said Tarza nonchalantly.\n\n\u201cHello, Tarza,\u201d said Prod.\n\n\u201cHiya, Tarza,\u201d said Dusty with a wave of his mechanical arm.\n\n\u201cYou know them?\u201d asked Jackson.\n\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d smiled Tarza. \u201cI\u2019m the one that built them.\u201d \n\nJackson felt more sweat get trapped by the foam.\n\n Chapter Six: Rick\u2019s Earth Parts Emporium\n\n                        Prod and Dusty were identical in almost every way. They stood four feet tall, including their antennae, with two legs and two arms each. Their shiny chrome torsos were forged from the same piece of metal, delivered from Earth many years ago to their builder, Tarza. Their mouths opened exactly 3.5 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall. They were so similar, and some might say such exquisite specimens of robotics, that the only notable and discernible difference between Prod and Dusty was the color of their high-definition eye lenses. Prod could be identified by her brown lenses, and Dusty by his green. Apart from that (and the fact that Dusty always wore a shining, spinning disco ball on top of his antennae) they were indistinguishable from each other.\n\nBut even if you removed all accessories and swapped their eye colors, Tarza could always tell them apart. It was a trick they tried to get her with many times, but never successfully.\n\n\u201cDusty, you need to clean your disco ball,\u201d she said as he stomped up to her foam-encased body. \n\nDusty stopped moving and began to rotate the ball on his head at a blazing speed. Dust and particles flew off of it until it was as sparkly as the day Tarza found it. As it slowed back down, she was reminded of how enamored Dusty had been of it, as it rotated in front of him. How his eyes had never left it. And how he had insisted that it stay on his head from then on (except when loaning it to Prod for a practical joke).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 you built these robots?\u201d asked Jackson, with genuine surprise and not just a little bit of admiration. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Tarza, \u201cmy real job here is engineer. Recognize anything about them?\u201d\n\nJackson stared intently at Prod and Dusty. He had seen a few robots in his time, but most of them were White House staff bots that didn\u2019t have arms, legs, or faces. They rolled around and collected things like food and trash and sometimes messages. \n\n\u201cShould I?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTheir chassises, joints, lights- all of it! All their parts were sourced from Earth. Your planet!\u201d she said excitedly. It was most likely that she had gotten the parts directly from Rick\u2019s Earth Parts Emporium. And if she hadn\u2019t, she certainly would have gotten a better deal with Rick, who is known for having the best prices of any Earth-based, Earth parts emporium.\n\nJackson, upon seeing Tarza\u2019s genuine smile at having built her robots from Earth parts, and finding that he liked seeing it more than he expected, decided to ignore the fact that had an equally genuine lack of knowledge of anything mechanical.\n\n\u201cAh, yes! Now I see it! I\u2019d recognize those joints anywhere!\u201d\n\nTarza smiled even larger and gave him a proud nod. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like Earth parts. So much personality to them!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, since you built them, can you make them let us go? Can we still escape?\u201d Jackson asked. The thought of being interviewed by the Inspector a second time was making Jackson more nervous than ever. His sweat was running down from his head to his feet. \n\nTarza shook her head.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s up to them what they do,\u201d she answered. \u201cBesides, they\u2019ve made good careers for themselves here and I\u2019m proud of them. I would never ask them to risk that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEscape request from captive named President Racha recorded and logged,\u201d Prod said, while staring up at Jackson.\n\n\u201cGreat work, Prod!\u201d encouraged Tarza. \n\nProd let out a gleeful \u201cBEEP\u201d. \n\nJackson shook his head in discouragement. However, he was met with a sudden, yet tiny sense of encouragement when he realized that his neck was moving more freely, right where it met his clavicle. It was the exact place where sweat from a forehead might find itself after a minute or two of traveling downward.\n\n\u201cTarza? Why are you stuck in foam? Why is captive, named President Racha, stuck in foam?\u201d asked Dusty. \n\n\u201cWell, the truth is, Dusty, I was trying to help the President escape,\u201d she said. \u201cBut turns out, that\u2019s not the President.\u201d\n\nDusty stomped over in front of Jackson. Prod followed behind.\n\n\u201cThis is not captive-named-President-Racha?\u201d asked Dusty.\n\n\u201cOrders were to watch captive-named-President-Racha,\u201d added Prod. \n\n\u201cNo\u2026 actually my, um, my name is\u2026\u201d Jackson started. Jackson\u2019s sweat began to flow throughout his torso and limbs, and he felt the foam dissolving slowly around it. He could wiggle his fingers and bend his knees slightly. He reasoned that if he could play up his nervousness, his sweat would dissolve enough foam for him to escape.\n\nA tiny window opened up inside Dusty\u2019s chassis and Jackson furrowed his brow apprehensively as he saw a shiny suction cup poke out. He couldn\u2019t help but notice that it was aimed directly at his face.\n\n\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d he asked.\n\nTarza replied excitedly, \u201cThey\u2019re going to independently verify your identity. Brilliant, Dusty!\u201d\n\nWith the little mobility he had in his neck, Jackson tried desperately to squirm out of the way, but within seconds the suction cup shot forward with a cord attached and stuck to Jackson\u2019s forehead with an unsettling yet satisfying \u201cFLERP\u201d. Crossing his eyes to look up at the suction cup, Jackson no longer felt any need to increase his nervousness. Foam was beginning to dissolve at a rapid pace.\n\nThis was the kind of moment that would have normally sent Jackson into a state of silent confusion. However, since his conversation with Tarza, he had found it more difficult to do nothing without feeling a sense of shame. Indeed, her talk had forced him to adapt to a new response to unknown circumstances and stimuli. In this initial trial of a new method, he tried instead \u201cloud panic\u201d. \n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?! What are they doing?!\u201d Jackson tried moving his head back and forth to lose the suction cup, but only sent a rippling wave through the cord.\n\n\u201cRelax,\u201d said Tarza. \u201cHe\u2019ll give it right back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive what back??\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name memory,\u201d she replied cooly.\n\n\u201cMy name memory? He\u2019s going to take it? Wait! I\u2019ll tell you my name. You can wear those glasses\u2026\u201d Jackson pleaded.\n\nTarza shook her head as much as she could. \u201cRobs don\u2019t wear glass. Imagine if they did,\u201d she chuckled to Plod. \n\n\u201cImagine,\u201d repeated Plod. \n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll just tell you! My real name is Theodore Fickle but I prefer\u2014\u201c\n\nBefore he could finish, Theodore Fickle (the name he was assigned at birth, but not the name that he was about to say) found himself suddenly thrust into his first grade classroom. \n\nChapter Seven: Saturn Cocoa Bars\n\n                   \n\n                     He felt his hair, recently buzzed, by barber not by choice, due to a lice infestation that had just spread through his home. Although never confirmed, Theodore \u201cJackson\u201d Fickle, would always blame his youngest sister for the infestation (and the humiliation). As he sat in his memory, listening to Mr. Langdon, Jackson recalled that the short, jolly teacher was his second favorite of all time. His first favorite teacher was his third grade teacher, Ms. Polly, and his third favorite teacher was his second grade teacher Mrs. Julba. incidentally, his least favorite teacher had his first favorite name, Mr. Prestidigitalio. He had taught kindergarten, and refused to call Jackson, \u201cJackson\u201d. \n\nJackson felt his hand raise, excited to answer a question that had just been asked. Something about tuna fish. No. his brain was confused now. The question was about the ocean, but the answer was not tuna fish, but rather salt water. Mr. Langdon scanned the room then settled on the hand of young Jackson. With a broad smile, he called on him.\n\n\u201cAh, Theodore Fickle has the answer!\u201d\n\nJackson felt his smile lessen. He did not like having to correct people. He shuffled in his seat and cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cUm, my real name is Theodore Fickle, but everyone calls me Jackson,\u201d he said in an uneven and high-pitched voice.\n\nThe colors of the room began to blend together. Inexplicably, the room itself started to stretch and warp, and then slide out of view, until Jackson saw nothing but black. He couldn\u2019t remember where he had just been. He couldn\u2019t remember what he had just heard. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take too much, now Dusty. Remember to put most of it back,\u201d Tarza\u2019s voice cut through. \n\nSuddenly the colors came streaming back into his mind. The lines were still a bit smudged, but it was his classroom once again. Mr. Langdon was there, with a smile that was, for just a moment, larger than any Jackson had ever seen. As the scene settled, everything was right again. \n\nHe felt the suction cup leave his forehead with a soft \u201cPOP\u201d and he was back in the ship, looking at two robots. Dusty\u2019s tiny metal window closed again.\n\nJackson was wobbly. So wobbly, in fact, that he realized the foam had lost its grip on him.\n\n\u201cName confirmed. Not President Racha.\u201d\n\nDusty and Plod turned towards each other. \n\n\u201cNew directive required,\u201d said Plod.\n\nJackson had had enough. Breaking through the thin layer of foam around his arms, Jackson tried out a second method, for the first time: heroic action.\n\n\u201cJackson, how did you\u2026\u201d\n\nWithout a word, Jackson kicked through the remaining foam and stepped out onto the cold, not-at-all-good-tasting floor. He stood tall, feeling strong and courageous. \n\n \n\nDusty and Plod hastily wheeled to opposite sides of the room and stayed there.\n\nJackson tried to break Tarza free, but her foam was too thick. He tried to pull it away from her, even lifting his leg against it for leverage, but could not get it to budge. He found himself feeling less strong and courageous by the second.\n\n\u201cHow do I get you out?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d said Tarza. \u201cThe green levers on the control panel.\u201d\n\nJackson pulled down on the closest of two green levers and a mist covered his former pod and dissolved all the remaining foam. Without hesitation, he pulled the second and Tarza was soon sprayed herself. With nothing left but a few shreds of foam on her clothes, she stepped down onto the floor, licking her lips.\n\n\u201cMmmm, butterscotch flavored spray. You missed out.\u201d\n\nTarza stomped around, searching every inch of the room.\n\n\u201cQuick, we\u2019ve got to find the Warp-Pods!\u201d\n\nJackson brushed himself off and started kicking the last remaining bits of foam. \n\n\u201cMaybe they got frozen in the foam with us!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tarza, shaking her head. \u201cThe foam only freezes living beings and their clothing. It\u2019s very smart. In fact, it was a Byzong inventor who realized that you can isolate not just carbon beings but their\u2026 wait a second\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Jackson, glad that she had been cut short before going even further over his head.\n\n\u201cThey must still be there! The foam would\u2019ve let them drop to the floor! Come on!\u201d Tarza grabbed Jackson\u2019s hand and he felt an electric buzz shoot all the way up to his shoulder. Although new, and startling to him, it was not an unpleasant sensation.\n\nThey raced through the corridors as fast as their legs would take them. When a Byzong intern passed by, Jackson tucked behind Tarza, making himself as inconspicuous as possible, and the intern passed by without noticing. Before reaching the blue lit room again, Jackson noticed a vending machine that read \u201cGalaxy Sweets\u201d Having not eaten since the few bites of tuna fish sandwich that sent him through a black hole, and having just been frozen in foam for three hours, Jackson was understandable stavrving. \n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, pulling Tarza to a stop. \u201cI need to eat something. Can you get me one of these?\u201d\n\nTarza whispered hastily. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me! there\u2019ll be plenty of time for snacks once we\u2019ve been picked up by the Pocket Watches!\u201d\n\nJackson grabbed at his belly. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve eaten. I\u2019m starving! Plus I\u2019m not used to breaking out of things like that. It took it out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you do that, anyway?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI sweat when I\u2019m nervous,\u201d he answered sheepishly. \u201cHuman sweat must dissolve the foam.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises, aren\u2019t you,\u201d she replied. She looked at him with sympathy. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019re hungry I suppose. Black holes can sometimes reserve your intestines. Fine. But be quick about it.\u201d\n\nMaking a firm and immediate decision to ignore her comment on his intestines, Jackson thanked her. Placing her hand on the side of the machine, the display shifted to ask which of three kinds of bars they would like. The first was a small bucket of rock-shaped candies called Grubble. The second was a long, green cylinder called Ozzback Ooze. And the last was a Saturn Cocoa Bar, the only one that Jackson recognized. \n\nJackson Fickle had long said that Saturn Cocoa Bar was his favorite sweet treat of all. However, in his lifetime until this point, he had consumed 457 Saturn Cocoa Bars. This meant that he had consumed Ruby Razzies at least one hundred times more. It also meant that he had chosen Chunkies Smooth and Creamies 62% of the time, when given an option between the two. By no commonly accepted metric and only by his self declaration, were Saturn Cocoa Bars his favorite. Yet, when he saw this option at the \u201cGalaxy Sweets\u201d vending machine, it was an easy and instant choice.\n\nHe touched the picture of the Saturn Cocoa Bar on the screen and smiled to Tarza. \u201cSaturn Cocoa Bars are my favorite.\u201d And as they raced down the hallway, he wasted no time in opening and taking a bite of the delectable candy bar, because while I may have said that Saturn Cocoa Bars fall in stature to Ruby Razzies and Chunkies Smooth and Creamies in Jackson Fickle\u2019s personal life archives, they are still the bar with the most chocolatey, crunchy, and out-of-this-world taste around. \n\nThe door to the room was still lit yellow. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky,\u201d said Tarza softly. \u201cLooks like no one\u2019s gone in since.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Jackson. He was ready to be off of the chaotic Byzong warship that had brought him confusion, interrogation, and foam confinement. So it was a letdown, if not a downright disappointment, when he took his first step in the control room and saw a group of three Byzong accountants standing around a high top table mumbling numbers out loud as they worked. \n\nThe pair froze, unblinking, as the accountants stopped and turned to meet their eyes. Tarza immediately spotted the two Warp Pods, still lying on the floor up against the far wall. \n\nThe accountants stared for a breath before one spoke up.\n\n\u201cWhat impressive confidence you both have to open a red door! We\u2019re going over the numbers for the month. Are you here to help?\u201d asked the Byzong accountant with the largest, loudest looking shoes. \n\n\u201cYou have wonderful taste in rooms,\u201d said Tarza through a forced smile. \u201cWe\u2019re not accountants, this is just\u2026 our favorite place to work as well\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you outrank us?\u201d asked the accountant, matter-of-factly.\n\n\u201cWell, no I don\u2019t think so\u2026 we just\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need the room,\u201d explained the accountant, turning back towards the work in front of him. \u201cWith so much ruckus going on around here it\u2019s a wonder we found a place at all.\u201d\n\nThe accountants resumed mumbling and searching through numbers on the computers in front of them, sending the most pertinent to a holographic pillar in the center of the table at a rapid pace. \u201cTwelve thousand, four hundred and ninety three. Four-thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine,\u201d said another. \u201cEighty-one. Three hundred and two. Four.\u201d muttered another.  The third was rattling off numbers at such a speed that neither Tarza nor Jackson could understand.\n\nTarza leaned over. \u201cWhat are we going to do? The Warp Pods are right over there.\u201d\n\nJackson cocked his head in thought. \u201cDid you notice, Tarza, that they didn\u2019t say anything about me being human\u2026?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d whispered Tarza. \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t notice?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, regaining full volume. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t care\u2026\u201d\n\nJackson began walking forward, but Tarza reached out to stop him. \n\n\u201cWait!\u201d she yelled. They both looked at the accountants. There was no reaction. Only working. \n\n\u201cFifty-seven. Fifty-seven point five.\u201d said the head accountant.\n\nTarza mouthed her next words with barely a sound. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\nJackson smirked. \u201cYou wanted me to be a person of action right? Well, I\u2019m testing a theory.\u201d\n\nFeeling bolder, he walked behind the accountants and held out his arms. \u201cWabble Wabble Wablle!\u201d he yelled. The accountants continued sending numbers to the pillar with startling speed. \u201cOne hundred twenty one thousand and one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President has a team of accountants, a whole slew of them, and they never seem interested in absolutely anything other than numbers. I saw one eat their lunch once without ever even looking at it!\u201d The meal he was referring to had been a tuna fish sandwich with a side of chips. Mind you, this was not the same tuna fish sandwich that had set Jackson on a course to this very room, of course. The tuna fish sandwich that Jackson had been eating earlier this day had been a traditional composition of white albacore tuna and mayo on white bread. The tuna fish sandwich being referred to indirectly at the current time, had been made with chunk light tuna, and a generous helping of mayonnaise, mustard, and relish on rye bread, five months earlier. \n\nTarza walked forward hesitantly. \u201cSo\u2026 they\u2019re not even listening?\u201d she asked.\n\nJackson nodded. \u201cI think they\u2019re even worse than the human accountants.\u201d\n\nSimilarly to the accountants, Tarza had only one thought on her mind. Hesitantly, still not sure if she could trust Jackson\u2019s theory, Tarza made her way over to the Warp Pods and grabbed them from the floor. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d she said to herself. \u201cWe got em!\u201d\n\nTarza spun around to hand Jackson his Warp Pod, but having become comfortable in the knowledge that they could do whatever they wanted, he was now finishing the rest of his Saturn Cocoa Bar and reading the back of the wrapper. \n\n\u201cAmazing. Only ninety-five calories in the entire bar.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety-five\u201d repeated, the head accountant absent-mindedly. He shook his head at the mistake then turned to face Jackson with a fierce scowl. It sent shivers down his spine.\n\n\u201cWhat charming, small ears you have\u2026\u201d said the head accountant with a vicious glare. He stepped forward and towered over Jackson with his large metal shoes, tall ears, and intimidating size. \u201cWhat is a human doing on our ship, interfering with our budget calculation!\u201d\n\nTarza made a quick calculation and watched on in wonder, as Jackson backed up, stumbled over his feet, and landed his rear end squarely on the green button of the control panel. The room was instantly filled with foam once again, this time trapping one human and four Byzongs. \n\n Chapter Eight: Ronald Elastic\u2019s Goo-Be-Goon\n\nBy the time Jackson woke up this time, his head was already out of the foam. Tarza had been awake, with her head freed, for 2 minutes and 39 seconds before him. As his eyes adjusted from his second foam-induced nap, he made out the fuzzy shape of a slender Byzong standing in front of them. He knew it instantly to be Inquisitor Slah.\n\nClearly in the middle of an important conversation with Tarza, Jackson decided the best course of action would be to close his eyes again, and listen to the Inquisitor before making his presence known.\n\n\u201cIt will be not pleasant,\u201d said the Inquisitor in a sinister tone. \u201cBut if you comply with me now, I will make sure that your punishment lasts only three orbits. Otherwise you may face as many as ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cComply with you how?\u201d snapped Tarza. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to confess, nothing to admit, and nothing to say.\u201d\n\nJackson couldn\u2019t help but smile ever-so-slightly.\n\n\u201cShall I write down all three of those?\u201d asked an assistant. \u201cSeems a bit redundant to me.\u201d\n\nJackson heard the jarringly loud footsteps of the Inquisitor as she approached Tarza, and tried his best not to wince.\n\n\u201cJust put down that the prisoner is hostile,\u201d smirked the Inquisitor.\n\n\u201cHostile,\u201d scoffed Tarza. \u201cI\u2019m not the one about to drain a planet of all its water.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s eyes opened almost involuntarily to watch.\n\nThe Inquisitor leaned in, just inches from Tarza\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cIs that why you tried to free their President? Why you concocted that false alarm? Because you thought you could save them?\u201d Inquisitor Slah gave a cold smirk.\n\nThe guards behind her looked at each other and laughed.\n\nJackson felt a sense of dread that he had not felt the entire time he\u2019d been on the Byzong Warship. \n\n\u201cTell me, in all the years of earth\u2019s existence, how many times have they battled the Byzongs?\u201d asked the Inquisitor. \u201cPresident Racha?\u201d She turned her head sharply until her eyes rested on Jackson\u2019s.\n\nHe froze. \n\n\u201cNo answer?\u201d she pressed. \u201cWell allow me to enlighten you. In the 4.543 billion years that your planet has existed, you have battled the Byzong\u2019s exactly zero times. In fact, your planet has somehow managed to never, not once, be attacked by a foreign planet. Do you know how rare that is?\u201d\n\nJackson let out a breath that he\u2019d been holding in, by sheer coincidence, for 4.543 seconds, rounded to the nearest thousandth. He did want to know how rare that is, but found himself stating a fact of his own instead.\n\n\u201cI am not President Racha.\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor decided to no longer allow herself to be distracted by what she deemed to be the lies of a prisoner. In her years of Inquisitor training at the U U of U, she had trained under none other than the Byzong-renowned Inquisitor Saxel. \n\nIt was during one of their first labs, where Parlodin Turs, a species of vertebrae that most-closely resembles an earth rat, were introduced to distract and create chaos, that Inquisitor Saxel first introduced the idea of \u201cradical focus\u201d to not-yet-Inquisitor Slah. And with a Parlodin Tur taking a nap inside her left ear, she proved herself a rising star, by completing the interrogation of a fellow student with unmatched efficacy. Although she would, at times, engage with the frivolous answers of her captives, the Inquisitor reminded herself in this moment why she became known as Inquisitor Saxel\u2019s star pupil.\n\n\u201cThere are only three planets with sentient life, in the the entire known universe, who have never been at war with a foreign planet. The first is a planet whose inhabitants just became smart enough to qualify for inclusion in this list two hours ago. The planet is so primitive that it does not even have a name. And yet, a Vlop warship is on its way now to be the first to attack it anyway. They drew the honor in a raffle.\u201d\n\nJackson attempted to interject, with his real name once more, but radical focus, it has been said, is harder break than a brick wall. \n\n\u201cThe second,\u201d she continued, \u201cis a planet named Goozor. Goozor, and its primary species, the Goozons, are made entirely of a viscus jelly-like substance that sticks to your skin permanently on contact, and carries with it a smell so vile that anyone who touches it is banished to a distant solar system, where they are given a case of Ronald Elastic\u2019s Goo Be Gone, \u201cThe only gunk strong enough to get your goo gone for good,\u201d compliments of Those In Charge.\n\nThose in Charge, affectionately known as TIC, is a group of super-intelligent beings who rule all planets and species in existence. They govern from a central station called the Rainbow Realm, and their members are recruited as the best and brightest from all corners of the universe. It was actually a member of TIC who first discovered that the universe did, in fact, have corners. Of these corners, two are purely theoretical, while five have been observed. These corners are rumored to be dreadfully hard to clean, during the universe\u2019s Spring cleaning each cosmic year. \n\nIt is worth nothing that, while many dream of being summoned to the Rainbow Realm to become a member of TIC, Inquisitor Slah was never one of them.\n\n\u201cThe third is Earth. A planet so tribalistic that is has been at war with itself for eons. Until now, no civilization thought it worthwhile to invade, preferring instead to wait for the planet to either unite or self-destruct. But time has run out for your planet, President Racha. The need for your most precious resource has recently become\u2026 dire.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur oceans you mean? Why is there a dire need all of a sudden?\u201d Jackson was growing tired of the mounting questions in his head.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not important!\u201d she snapped. A pause. \u201cWell, it is important but I\u2019m not going to tell you. What I need from you is a layout of Earth\u2019s defense system. All of it.\u201d\n\nJackson and Tarza began to protest at the same time, but the Inquisitor simply raised a hand to stop them. \n\n\u201cI expected your objections. That\u2019s why we won\u2019t be waiting around for your cooperation.\u201d\n\nInquisitor Slah waved a hand towards a guard.\n\nDusty and Plod entered the room again and wheeled themselves in front of Jackson.\n\n\u201cOur ROBs will be extracting the memories of your defense meetings. We will soon have all the information we need to attack earth.\u201d The Inquisitor leaned in. \u201cAnd when we do, you will no longer be of any use to us.\u201d\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, Jackson saw her assistant shuffle in his chair and clear his throat. This Byzong also did not like being in the uncomfortable position of correcting his superior. In addition, their usual chair was being repaired for a taste malfunction, and their current chair was designed for a Byzong with smaller hips than theirs, so they were shifting due to a literal uncomfortable position as well. \n\n\u201cUm, remember what the Boss said?\u201d The Byzong immediately sunk down in his chair to appear smaller, but this only made the chair even less comfortable, which he would already have deemed an \u201cAwful\u201d on the U U of U\u2019s Discomfort Scale for Clothing, Conversations, and Chairs, which ran from \u201cPerfect\u201d to \u201cPerfectly Awful\u201d.\n\nInquisitor Slah narrowed her eyes at Jackson in disgust. She let out a scalding sigh. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky that the Boss believes you to be an important bargaining chip. Otherwise I\u2019d throw you right back into that black hole and leave you there.\u201d\n\nJackson tasted peppermint.\n\nThe Inquisitor backed up and smirked. \n\n\u201cNow, these ROBs will find your memory no matter how long it takes, and this time, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t escape\u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nAs the Inquisitor moved to the back of the room to join her assistants behind blinking control panels, Jackson and Tarza looked at each other. \n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d whispered Jackson. \u201cShe\u2019ll find out I\u2019m not the President and then she\u2019ll toss me into that black hole!\u201d\n\nTarza furrowed her brow in thought. \u201cDusty and Plod must not have told her who you are yet. If I know them, they\u2019re still running calculations on who to trust. If I can convince them to help us, we might have a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d asked Jackson.\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d she answered. And despite himself. Despite having just met her on a strange ship under stranger circumstances, he did.\n\nDusty and Plod wheeled themselves over in front of Jackson and prepared to take his memories.\n\n\u201cInquisitor!\u201d shouted Tarza. \n\nThe Inquisitor looked up from her station.\n\n\u201cI fear you\u2019re going to waste an awful lot of time looking for his memories.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d replied the Inquisitor. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d said Tarza. \u201cHe\u2019s the President of Earth. Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s been trained on memory repression. You could spend weeks, if not months, trying to find the information you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he\u2019d better get comfortable,\u201d she said coldly. Without glancing up again, she began fiddling with buttons and mechanisms.\n\nDusty and Plod got closer.\n\nTarza shook her head. \u201cBut, there\u2019s a better way!\u201d\n\n\u201cOut with it,\u201d said Inquisitor Slah from across the room.\n\n\u201cHe told me about their defenses!\u201d blurted Tarza.\n\nThe Inquisitor stopped what she was doing. \n\n\u201cHe did?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d nodded Tarza. \u201cWe discussed them at length. I can tell you exactly when and where he told me. You can find the conversation easily. Even the best memory suppression won\u2019t stop a targeted search like that.\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitor pondered this. \u201cYou expect me to trust a traitor? You\u2019re just as likely to lead us on a wild scronge chase.\u201d\n\nBefore Slah could consider grabbing her pair of X-Ring Lie Detector Glasses, Tarza spoke out again.\n\n\u201cHe also told me about their counteroffensive\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCounteroffensive?\u201d Inquisitor Slah stood up sharply.\n\n\u201cThats right,\u201d said Tarza. \u201cThey\u2019ve known about your plans for a while now. They have spies too, you know.\u201d \n\nThe Inquisitor was flummoxed. \u201cAnd\u2026 and why would you help us now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make a deal. I tell you where to find the memories and you let me go.\u201d\n\nSlah rubbed her chin. \u201cYou give up the memories, and then I will decide if they are worthy of release.\u201d\n\nTarza shook her head and closed her eyes. \u201cNo deal. I need assurances or else you can go fishing in his head for as long as it takes for all I care. He\u2019ll never give them up.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cfishing in his head\u201d did not sit well with Jackson. He had gone fishing with his mother once back on Earth. After three hours on the lake by his childhood home, Jackson had gone home soaking wet, smelling like worms, and without a fish.

But, you\u2019ve just revealed that the information we need is in your head now, too.

She was now in the 2nd grade and it was her first day of school.\nAs she finished her breakfast, she looked out of the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus.\n\u201cMommy, can I ride the bus?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d mommy said.Sophia was even more excited.\nShe jumped up from the table to go to the bus stop. Then her Mommy said, \u201cYes, you can ride the bus next week but I\u2019ll walk with you to school for the first week.\u201d Sophia was sad and confused. She thought her Mommy said she could ride the bus but then kind of changed the answer.\nSophia wondered why her Mommy just didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d.  At least then she wouldn\u2019t have gotten so excited. \u201cOh well,\u201d Sophia sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s go, it is a long walk.\u201d\nSeveral days later, the music teacher talked with Sophia\u2019s class.\nShe explained about all the instruments and had the 3rd graders demonstrate each of them.\nSophia heard the flute and thought that it made the prettiest sound she had ever heard. \u201cCan I play the flute?\u201d Sophia asked. \u201cWell, that depends,\u201d replied the music teacher. \u201cFirst, you need to get your parents\u2019 permission, and then join the band. You also need to know that learning to play the flute, or any instrument, takes a lot of hard work.\nNow, if you are willing to put in the work and you parents let you join the band, then the answer is YES. And I would be happy to have you join. We need another good flutist.\u201d Sophia was so excited and couldn\u2019t wait to ask her mommy.\nSchool was over and as Sophia walked out of the door, she saw her mommy waiting. She ran down the sidewalk, yelling out \u201cI want to play the flute. Can I play the flute? I want to join the band.\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, Sophia.\u201d her mommy said. Sophia took a deep breath, counted to three, and said, \u201cCan I please play the flute in the school band?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course you can,\u201d her Mommy replied.              \nOh, Sophia was so very happy. She had gotten permission and was now going to play the flute in the band.\nHer Mommy then said, \u201cYes, you can play an instrument just like I did.\nThe tuba is a great instrument and you can even have mine. The same one I used when I was in band.\u201d\nOh, poor Sophia, she was so sad. She wanted to play the flute, not the tuba.\nSophia just didn\u2019t understand why her Mommy said \u201cyes\u201d when she asked but really meant \u201cno\u201d. At least \u201cno\u201d for the instrument Sophia really wanted to play.\n\u201cMaybe I won\u2019t join the band,\u201d Sophia said in a low, sad voice. \u201cWell, that\u2019s up to you,\u201d her Mommy replied.\nAs Sophia finished her breakfast, she looked out the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus.

DAYDREAMS.\nI was sitting in class when I first saw it.\n\n\tMiss Weaver had been my teacher for a few months, and was known around Stagwood Elementary for the stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head. Before the school year started, I\u2019d heard a few rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true. For one thing, she did, in fact, wear the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly boring. It was the kind of boring that made your eyes shut without permission. The biggest problem, though, was the stories. She was obsessed with tales of former students who had become some kind of famous. The first couple of times weren\u2019t bad, maybe even kind of interesting. But, by the second week of school she had started repeating herself, just like her outfits. \n\n\tBy then, I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who got excellent marks in Math. The State Senator who was a teacher\u2019s pet. I knew every word. So, instead of trying my hardest to listen, I spent most of class drawing in my notebook. \n\n\tMost days, I drew imaginary places and then spent the rest of the time whipped up creatures to live there. They\u2019d have horns where horns don\u2019t go, fur where scales should be, and all the wings. They were odd. And they each had a story that I wanted to tell. But, on that day, I never even got to the first pair of wings. I had barely gotten started when it appeared, and changed Stagwood, and me, forever.\n\n\tIf it had chosen to press its little green face against any other window, I might not have seen it. And if I hadn\u2019t been trying to decide whether my dragon should have four legs or two, I might not have looked out window at that exact moment, dropping my pencil on the page. \n\n\tIt was a frog. And it was staring right at me.\n\n\tI couldn\u2019t stop looking at the frog and it couldn\u2019t stop looking back. We were locked in a staring contest. Maybe some frogs blinked, but with its eyes smushed against the glass, this one didn\u2019t. Stagwood Forest was just beyond the schoolyard and it was riddled with frogs, but they always avoided people. I knew right away, in a way that I could think better than I could say, that this frog was different.\n\n\tI tried to listen back in to Miss Weaver, just in time to hear the end of her story about Martin Shandals, the now-famous comedian. Martin had transferred schools half way through the year, so I always felt to me like that one shouldn\u2019t count. We were supposed to be learning long division, but something had reminded her of Martin. I knew exactly what bad joke she would end the story with, but much less about long division. \n\n\t\u201cWhenever he acted up in class I\u2019d say, \u2018we\u2019ve got a real comedian on our hands don\u2019t we?\u2019 And I was right!\u201d she said with a guffaw. \n\n\tI was certain that Miss Weaver would see the frog within moments, but I was wrong. Nobody did. More importantly, when I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something new. Something shiny. And when I realized what it was, I forgot all about class, and Miss Weaver, and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: the frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses. \n\n\tI wanted to lecture it, to explain that frogs don\u2019t wear glasses. It bothered me that it didn\u2019t already know that. On top of that, it had been staring at me for at least five minutes by then. And that seemed to be bordering on rude. Could a frog even be rude? I wasn\u2019t sure. But, the bigger question was why it was so interested in me.\n\n\tI wasn't the type of kid who got attention. Teachers always wrote \u201cneeds to participate more\u201d on my report cards (with a smiley face to make my parents feel better). I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose. A few years earlier, I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment. I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess. The custodian, Mr. Salazar, charged outside with a mop and brought me with him to point out the puddle. My guess is that we wasted a half-hour looking around at the dry gravel. Luckily, my mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change (\u2026or that it hadn\u2019t rained in weeks). \n\n\tThat\u2019s how it was. Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair, nobody cared, and almost nobody said my name. As far as school was concerned, all those things had happened to \u201csome kid\u201d. So, why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at \"some kid\"? \n\n\tTeachers, on the other hand, were a different story. Once her lesson started back up, it didn\u2019t take Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn\u2019t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. \n\n\t\u201cSince you don\u2019t feel the need to listen, why don\u2019t you solve a problem on the board instead?\u201d she said, sitting down at her desk. \n\n\tMy stomach did a flip. Then it did a flop. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down?\n\n\tI walked to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog easily in secret. Despite the distraction, I did my best to focus. But, it wasn\u2019t easy. Halfway through, I saw the frog move towards the front of the classroom. It stopped at the window next to Miss Weaver\u2019s desk. It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing, and another to believe it. It was trying to lift the window!\n\n\tFinishing the problem became almost impossible. I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. By the time I looked over again, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed. Bending down to pick it up, I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone. \u201cIt\u2019s not there. I just think it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\n\tWhen I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver\u2019s left shoulder. \n\n\tThis was a brave frog.\n\n\tHer head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could. Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn\u2019t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn\u2019t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her orange striped jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. I tried to remind myself of the situation. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver\u2019s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.\n\n\tNow that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn\u2019t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contact lenses small enough for a frog. But, it wasn\u2019t the right time to worry about frog vision- that would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.\n\n\tI had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It really was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me off. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an impressive daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn\u2019t be real. I shook my head confidently. \n\n\tWhen I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver\u2019s hair.\n\n2. SOY.\nI didn\u2019t see the frog for the rest of the day. Maybe it stayed in Miss Weaver\u2019s hair or maybe it jumped back through the window when I wasn\u2019t looking. All day long, I expected her to find it and let out a scream, but she never did. \n\n\tWhen the bell rang, I ran out of the school onto the side of the grass that had the most bushes. I had seen frogs hide in there before, but there was no sign of any. Truthfully, I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do with the frog if I had found it. Would I capture it? Would I ask it questions? If I was caught talking to a frog outside the school, I think people might finally start to remember me, but in a #donttalktothefrogkid kind of way. \n\n\tI liked most of the kids in my class just fine, but I was only really close with one. His name was Soy, and he was definitely, without a doubt, my best friend. Soy had kind of reddish-blond hair and a round face. He and I had been friends since preschool, and I knew that I could talk to him about anything. The downside to that was that he also felt he could talk to me about anything. Since he had eight older brothers and two older sisters, his questions were always about things that I didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t want to.\n\n\tHere\u2019s how it would usually go: Soy\u2019s brothers would talk about older kids things, and then make fun of him for not getting it. He would ask me about it, and we\u2019d look it up. It only took a few Google searches for me to get banned from using the Internet with Soy. \n\nThe bottom line was that if I was going to tell anyone about the frog, it would be Soy. I decided that our walk home would be the best chance. \n\n\t\u201cDid you see anything outside today during math?\u201d I asked Soy as we started walking. \n\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean? On the grass?\u201d he asked, jumping over cracks in the sidewalk. \n\n\t\u201cI mean right outside the window. Like right up against it,\u201d I answered.\n \t\u201cLike a person?\u201d he asked, still hopping. \n\n\tSoy sat in the row farthest from the window, so it would\u2019ve been possible, but still weird, for someone to walk by without him noticing. \n\n\t\u201cNo. It\u2019s more like\u2026 I saw a frog up against the window,\" I explained.\n \t\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cYeah, but it wasn\u2019t a normal frog. It opened the window and it came in the classroom and jumped on Miss Weaver\u2019s shoulder and it jumped inside her hair,\u201d I spit out. \n\n\tSoy stopped jumping and looked at me. \n\n\t\u201cThat happened\u2026 today?\u201d he asked. \n\n\t\u201cYeah, I mean I\u2019m pretty sure. And when I thought I might be making it up, the frog nodded at me,\u201d I said. \n\n\tSoy looked confused. I thought I heard something move in the tree above us, but Soy answered before I could look. \n\n\t\u201cIt nodded at you? I don\u2019t even think frogs have necks, do they?\u201d said Soy.\n \t\u201cThis one did, I guess. I mean most frogs don\u2019t wear glasses either, but it had those too,\u201d I explained.\n \tAll of a sudden, Soy seemed a couple steps further away. \n\n\t\u201cThe frog was wearing glasses?\u201d he asked suspiciously.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d I shot back.\n \t\u201cWhy would someone go around putting glasses on frogs?\u201d he asked.\n\n\t\"I dunno\u2026 maybe it bought them on its own,\u201d I replied. \n\n\tSoy was standing at least ten steps away now. \n\n\t\u201cRight\u2026 Well, maybe Miss Weaver will let us look in her hair tomorrow, and we can ask the frog where it got \u2018em\u2026 So, I think I\u2019m just gonna head back home today instead of coming over. My mom has lots of stuff for me to do. See you later!\u201d Soy said, turning to run away. \n\n\t\u201cSoy!\u201d I yelled. \u201cStop right there. I can prove the frog is real.\u201d \n\n\t\u201cOh yeah? How?\u201d he asked with an eye roll.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s sitting on your backpack,\u201d I said. \n\n3. THE TREEHOUSE. \nSoy had the frog in his hands within seconds. He was always good with outdoorsy stuff like that. His mom was usually busy with his siblings, so Soy was left to play outside a lot. By third grade, he had caught a pet turtle, salamander, and flying squirrel. Unfortunately, his older brothers Rick and Hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room. Once a week they played a game where Rick threw the squirrel from the second story window, and Hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down. Soy tried to get them to stop, but they never listened. It wasn\u2019t until a particularly windy fall day that he caught a gust and flew over their heads to freedom.\n\n\tThe frog didn\u2019t put up much of a fight. I started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught. \n\n\t\u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d I asked.\n \tSoy peaked inside his hands, and then lifted his head with wide eyes. \"Well\u2026 this frog is wearing glasses. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\n\tBoth of our minds were racing with questions. \n \t\u201cLet\u2019s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,\u201d I said. \n\n\tI had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself. My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools, but that was about it. Building things always made me feel good afterwards, and I had gotten pretty good at it. The treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter.  \n\n\tWhen we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn\u2019t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn\u2019t run away (and also to give us some privacy). \n\n\t\u201cOkay, Soy,\u201d I said, \"let him loose.\" \n\n\tSoy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn\u2019t move at all. \n\n\tInstead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018him\u2019?\u201d\n \tSoy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head.\n \t\"It\u2019s rude to assume I\u2019m a \u2018he\u2019, don\u2019t you think? I happen to be a girl,\u201d said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. \n\n\t\u201cIt can talk!!\u201d he said in disbelief.\n \t\"Calling me an \u2018it\u2019, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy!\u201d she insisted.\n\n\tI knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a \u201cMade in China\u201d sticker really make me feel better? It\u2026 she\u2026 had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before. \n\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said to the frog, kneeling down, \u201cwe didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Truly.\u201d\n \tThe frog hopped even closer and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been kind.\u201d Then she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful thing. Remember that.\u201d\n \t\u201cI will,\u201d I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. \n\n\t\u201cBut, um, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?\u201d I said. \n\n\tBy that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. \n\n\tThe frog crooked her head at me slightly. \u201cDo you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?\u201d she asked. \n\n\tI was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. \n\n\t\"That\u2019s not okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he\u2019s been talking to.\u201d\n \tThe frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just kidding. Animals can\u2019t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.\u201d \n\n\tI was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. \n\n\t\u201cWhat about some kind of iguana sign language?\u201d asked Soy, still nervous. \n\n\tIgnoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, \u201cHow is it that you can? Talk, I mean.\" \n\n\t\u201cFor starters, I\u2019m not a frog,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe only reason that I\u2014\u201d \n\n\tWithout any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. \n\n\t\u201cWhat are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?\u201d asked my mom sternly.\n \tI searched my brain for an answer that didn\u2019t have the word frog in it. \n\n\t\u201cSoy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away.\" I replied.\n \t\u201cHe\u2019s a clever one\u201d the frog whispered to Soy. \n\n\tI gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that one had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a girl\u2019s voice, I was worried she might break through the door again. She had a habit of doing that any time something seemed suspicious. It was only a week before that she had seen the smoke from one of Soy\u2019s firecrackers and broken through three locks. I added the fourth the next day, but it was becoming clear to me that metal was no match for \u201cmom strength\u201d. So, for the moment, I needed this frog\u2019s vocabulary to shrink back down to \u201cribbit\u201d. \n\n\t\u201cWell, come on inside the house. There\u2019s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you.\u201d She lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door. \u201cHe looks pretty official. He\u2019s got a fancy suit and a shiny yellow bowtie. Don\u2019t worry though, he told me me you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d \n\n\t\u201cYellow?!\u201d screeched the frog.\n \t\u201cWhat was that, honey?\u201d\n \t\u201cOh\u2026 I said, \u2018Hello!\u2019\u201d I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.\n \t\u201cHoney, \u2018Hello\u2019 usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We\u2019re pretty far into this one,\u201d she answered.\n \t\u201cAh, right. I just sometimes forget when you\u2019re supposed to say it,\u201d I replied nervously. \n\n\t\u201cOh\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,\u201d she said, closer to the door than ever. \u201cBecause that\u2019s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.\u201d \n\n\tI heard my mom climb down the ladder, then watched her go back inside the house through the sliding back door. The frog jumped up onto the open treehouse window in a panic. I was amazed at how high she could jump, and knew at that moment that she could have left any time that she had wanted. \n\n\t\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t mention me,\u201d the frog whispered frantically. \u201cI\u2019ll find you later.\u201d \n\n\tAnd with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below.\n\n4. TIGER LILIES. \nI sent Soy home and told him not to say a word until we could agree on a plan. He was too frazzled to argue. Soy walked home along the path behind my house that crossed the woods to his. I had no choice but to head inside. When I slid the back door open, I saw my mom and the man in the bowtie sitting in the living room. She sat smiling by the fireplace, and he sat in the flowery love seat closest to the front door, taking up most of it with his long skinny frame. His tall legs were bent at sharp angles to both sides, just like his elbows. My mom and the man were mid-conversation when I walked in. I saw him notice me from the corner of his eye, but he kept speaking. \n\n\t\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely beautiful, Mrs. Caelum. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen lilium bulbiferum that vibrant before\u201d said the man as he touched the lilies that were on the table between them.\n \t\u201cOh, you\u2019re too nice!\u201d said my mom with a giggle. \n\n\tMy mom wasn\u2019t known for giggling, but flowers were one of her most favorite things in the world. She filled the house with them whenever she could. The most that my dad would say about it was that fake flowers would probably cost less. \n\n\t\u201cDoes your son have an appreciation for flowers as well?\u201d the man asked, finally turning to look at me. \n\n\tHis blond hair was pressed firmly against the top of his head, and his pale skin looked almost wet. His grin was toothy\u2026 larger than it should be. I felt uneasy. The talking frog had been surprising, odd even, but I preferred it to him.\n\n\t\u201cAh, there you are! Come have a seat and say hello to mister\u2026,\u201d my mother said, stopping for a moment. \u201cWhat was it again?\u201d\n \t\u201cReam,\u201d he finished. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, young man.\u201d\n \t\u201cHello,\u201d I said. \n\n\t\u201cWell done,\u201d my mom whispered happily at hearing me place my \u2018hello\u2019 correctly. \u201cMr. Ream is from the school board,\u201d she projected, \u201cand he\u2019s here to\u2026\u201d \n\n\tOnce again she wasn\u2019t sure how to finish her sentence. \n\n\t\u201cI\u2019m here to speak with you about Miss Weaver\u2019s class. We\u2019ve begun an initiative where we, the board members, speak directly with students to learn more about their experiences in the school system. We\u2019d like to have an open dialogue between the administration and the children.\u201d\n \t\u201cI think that\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d said my mom. \n\n\tShe was smiling ear to ear, looking for me to agree. I gave a nod, then waited for someone else to speak.\n\n\t\u201cMrs. Caelum, we\u2019ve found that students tend to be more free and honest with their feelings when their parents can\u2019t hear. I assure you, I\u2019ve been trained in creating an atmosphere where students can speak their mind without fear of punishment,\u201d said Mr. Ream.\n \t\u201cI see,\u201d said my mom. She turned to me and spoke in her usual kind voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to be right here in the kitchen if you need anything, sweetie. Remember that you can be honest with Mr. Ream, and nothing bad will happen. Okay?\u201d \n\n\tI nodded. Mr. Ream followed my mom with his eyes as she walked by him to the kitchen. She\u2019d been right about his suit. It was a dark blue and, from what I could tell, was fancy and expensive. But his bowtie was what stood out. It was a color yellow that I had never seen before, and I could see why she had mentioned it too. As he moved, the light reflected off of it in every direction. It didn\u2019t move like clothes usually do. In fact, it didn\u2019t move at all. I also couldn\u2019t help but notice that he was taller than my mom, even when he was sitting down. When she left the room he turned to me abruptly.\n\n\t\u201cHas anything strange happened at school in the past couple of days?\u201d\n\n\tI shook my head hard and fast. \n\n\t\u201cYou can tell me. I\u2019m here to help,\u201d he said in a friendly voice. \u201cYou see, I didn\u2019t tell your mom this because I didn\u2019t want to worry her\u2026\u201d \n\n\tNow Mr. Ream leaned in closer. His mouth looked larger by the second. I was almost positive that he could eat a whole sandwich in one bite. \n\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s a...\u201d he said, pausing, \u201cperson who has been bothering students. Some little birdies told me that perhaps they\u2019ve been bothering you. \u201d \n\n\tThen he gave the largest smile I had ever seen. Two sandwiches, at least. I knew, deep down, that he meant the frog. That\u2019s why she had acted so funny when she heard about his bowtie. \n\n\t\u201cWell, what does the person look like?\u201d I asked shyly.\n \t\u201cThat\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he replied, \u201cThis... person likes to disguise themselves in different ways. Ways that might even seem impossible.\u201d \n\n\tHis mouth was only a foot away now. Three sandwiches and a side of fries.. \n\n\tHe continued, \u201cThey may even be disguised as an animal.\"\n \n\n\tMy eyes got wide. Mr. Ream\u2019s got small.\n \t\u201cYou have seen them!\u201d Mr. Ream said, trying to hide his excitement. \n\n\tI shook my head defensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, you did.\"\n \t\u201cBut you have, haven\u2019t you,\u201d he said sympathetically. \u201cTell me what happened. It\u2019s for your own safety.\u201d \n\n\tI didn\u2019t know what to believe.\n \t\u201cWhat\u2019s so dangerous about her, anyway?\u201d I asked. \n\n\tThe moment I said it, I wished that I could take it back. I wished that I could grab the words out of mid-air and zip them right back into my mouth. But I knew that\u2019s not how words work. \n\n\t\u201c\u2018Her?\u2019\u201d he said.\n \tI couldn\u2019t look at him.\n\n\tHe spoke sharply in a whisper. \u201cSo, it\u2019s true. She has come to see you. Tell me why.\u201d \n\n\tI shook my head. \n\n\t\u201cWhy did she choose to reveal herself to you? Why you? Tell me!\u201d he demanded. \n\n\t\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d I answered despite myself. \u201cI was just...\u201d\n \t\u201cYou were just? You were just what?\u201d he prodded. \n\n\tI was confused, but I knew beyond a doubt that I did not want to tell him anything more. And I was not going to make the same mistake twice. \n\n\t\u201cI was just catching frogs in the woods with Soy and we didn\u2019t know it was a special frog and we caught it by accident, I swear, and she begged us to let her go, so we did,\u201d I said in one breath. \n\nMr. Ream sat back in his seat and listened to me ramble on.\n \u201cAnd she wanted nothing to do with us, and made us promise not to tell anyone about her, and\u2026 am I in trouble?\u201d I asked, pretending to cry. \n\n\tI had learned how to fake cry the year before when I tried out for a small part in the school play. As it turned out, the role of \u201cWeeping Willow\u201d wasn\u2019t even a speaking part. It\u2019s just a tree. No crying required. Still, after forty minutes of standing up on stage, not being allowed to move, I cried a little anyway. \n\n\t\u201cNo,\u201d he hissed, \u201cyou\u2019ve just disappointed me. I thought for a moment that you were the\u2026\u201d \n\n\tMy mom walked in smiling, with a vase in her hand.\n\n\t\u201cSorry to interrupt but I thought you might enjoy seeing my latest- \u201d she stopped inner tracks when she saw me. \n\n\t\u201cWhat are you two talking about in here?\u201d\n \t\u201cOh, Mrs. Caelum, your son and I were just \u2014,\u201d Mr. Ream sputtered.\n \t\u201cWhy is he crying??\u201d my mom asked more forcefully. She rushed to my side to console me.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Mr. Ream pleaded, \u201csometimes these talks can be emotional, and if you wouldn\u2019t mind my asking just a few more questions\u2026\u201d\n\n\tThe tears were flowing more freely now. I had become the Weepiest Willow in the world. \n \t\u201cI would mind,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cand if you\u2019d like to keep your job, you\u2019ll leave right now.\u201d \n\n\tMr. Ream straightened his jacket and grabbed a briefcase from behind the couch. \u201cYes, of course. Thanks for your time,\u201d he said. He opened the door and turned to me. \u201cBe sure to let me know if your story changes,\u201d he said with an unfriendly glare.\n\n\tMy mom put her arm around my shoulder. \n\n\t\u201cOut!\u201d she shouted.\n \tI spent the rest of the night listening to my mom speak on the phone with people from the school district. Apparently, Mr. Ream was highly regarded, but my mom didn't care. She was beyond angry. She yelled at some of the school people and even threatened to call the police once. By bedtime she seemed a little calmer. \n\n\tWhatever Mr. Ream wanted with that frog, it wasn\u2019t good. I decided then and there that I wasn\u2019t going to let him get to her. \n\n\tThe next morning my mom gave me an extra long hug and apologized (for the tenth time) for letting Mr. Ream into the house. I told her (for the tenth time) that it was all right. Soy and I met in front of my house to walk to school, as usual. I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since the treehouse, but it was immediately clear that he had gotten over his backpack-chewing phase. \n\n\t\u201cHow do you think it learned to talk? She, I mean. How come she could talk?\u201d he asked. Without waiting for answer, he continued, \u201cAnd how did it know my name? She, I mean.\u201d\n \t\u201cI don\u2019t know. Same as you,\u201d I said honestly.\n \t\u201cWhat about the dude with the bowtie?\u201d he asked excitedly. \n\n\t\u201cHis name is Mr. Ream. Soy\u2026 he knew about her,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cAbout the frog?\u201d Soy asked.\n \t\u201cYeah. He said that he was looking for someone who could disguise themselves as an animal. She was right to warn us. There was definitely something off about him.\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him anything, right?\u201d asked Soy. \n\n\tI looked down at the ground. \n\n\t\u201cI accidentally let on that I met her,\u201d I confessed.\n \t\u201cYou did what?\u201d Soy said in shock.\n \t\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. It came out by accident. And then Mr. Ream grilled me on why she had come to talk to me. Apparently, it\u2019s a big deal that she did.\u201d\n \t\u201cSo what\u2019d you do? Draw him a picture of it and tell him everything? Are you recording this conversation for him right now? My brothers say if you\u2019re wearing a wire you have to tell me,\u201d Soy said angrily. \n\n\t\u201cNo. Quit being silly, Soy. I told Mr. Ream that we were catching frogs, found her by accident, and let her go.\u201d\n \t\u201cOh. Okay, that\u2019s not bad actually,\u201d Soy said.\n \t\u201cThanks,\u201d I said with my head still hanging. \n\n\t\u201cAnd if he looks into it at all, the story will check out since I do love catching frogs. In fact, I should catch a few extra this week, just to be safe. So\u2026 what now?\u201d Soy asked.\n \t\u201cI really don\u2019t know, but we need to find out why that frog\u2019s here and why Mr. Ream is after her,\u201d I answered.\n \t\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d said Soy. \u201cI\u2019d take a frog in glasses over a man in a bowtie any day.\u201d\n\n\tIt felt good to have Soy on my side.\n\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out together,\u201d he said, patting me on the back. \n\n\tMy smile faded as he continued to pat\u2026 \n\n\tHe was checking for a wire.\n\n5. UN-TRADABLE LUNCH.\nThe first half of the day was more normal than I expected. Miss Weaver continued a Social Studies lesson and only stopped once for a story. \n\n\t\u201cThe legislative branch of the government is important. Probably the most important, if you ask me. It\u2019s quite remarkable, but a former student of mine is actually a State Senator now. One of the youngest we\u2019ve ever had! And since I was his favorite teacher, I can ask him for favors. I don\u2019t want to brag. I really hate to brag. But I can tell you that he\u2019s gotten me out of at least twenty parking tickets,\u201d she said with a proud laugh. \n\n\tI always wondered how many parking tickets you could get before they stopped letting you park. I didn\u2019t know how to drive yet, but of all the things you had to do, parking seemed the easiest. \n\n\tI had been too preoccupied to eat breakfast. My mind had been racing with questions. So by lunchtime I was starving. Soy and I sat together in the lunchroom everyday and we usually didn\u2019t care much about which spot. The lunchroom was long and narrow with brightly colored green, blue, and orange tables. With a secret subject to discuss, Soy and I decided to sit at the far end of the longest blue table, as close to the corner as we could get. There were twelve seats between us and any classmates, which was good because Soy\u2019s voice was known for being loud. After our third grade spelling bee, it was agreed, for everyone\u2019s sake, that Soy would never be allowed to speak into a microphone again. \n\n\t\u201cSo\u2026 how are we going to find the frog?\u201d he asked, looking around.\n \t\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not that good at finding regular frogs,\u201d I answered. \n\n\t\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking. Frogs like flies, right?\u201d\n \t\u201cYes.\u201d I started pulling my lunch out of my bag.\n \t\u201cAnd they like ponds?\u201d Soy added.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d I said again.\n \t\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cThat\u2019s not a plan though, Soy,\u201d I replied.\n \t\u201cThe rest is on you! I spent all morning on that,\u201d Soy shrieked. \n\n\tWhen I reached inside my bag again, I stopped trying to think of a plan. To be honest, my mom wasn\u2019t the best at packing lunch. Every once in awhile, she made one so bad that it was completely un-eatable and un-tradable. Still, she had never given me anything slimy. Never anything wet. And definitely never, ever anything that moved. There was no doubt in mind: I was holding a frog. \n\n\tIt had to be her. It was the only thing that made sense. Then I reminded myself that none of this truly made any sense. I tried not to panic, but I knew that I had to warn Soy from across the table, without causing a scene. The frog sat still, breathing in and out inside my hand. \n\n\t\u201cEets een my beg,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. \n\n\t\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d Soy asked with an eyebrow raised.\n \t\"I said, eeeets eeeenn my beg,\" I repeated. \n\n\t\u201cHuh? Who\u2019s seen your pig?\u201d\n\n\t\u201cNo, eeeeeets eeeeeen myyyy begggg,\u201d I said slowly.\n \t\u201cWait a second. Did you get a pig?\u201d Soy asked with his arms crossed. \u201cIf you really have a pig you better let me ride it...\u201d \n\n\tSoy was convinced that you could ride any animal larger than a cat. Also, sometimes cats. My mom said Soy was the reason we could never own any pets. \n\n\t\u201cSoy,\u201d I said, unclenching my teeth, \u201cput your hand in my bag.\u201d\n \tI slid the bag over and watched him stick his hand inside. His face changed immediately.\n \t\u201cOhhh,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s in your bag!\u201d\n \tThe frog must have somehow understood what was going on because she was still waiting patiently. \n\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s bring it out and ask it some questions,\u201d Soy said. \n\n\tThe bag moved a little bit. \n\n\t\u201cShe, I mean! Let\u2019s bring her out!\u201d he said too loudly.\n \t\u201cShh, we don\u2019t want anyone to hear,\u201d I whispered, trying to think of what to do next. \n\n\tSoy was eating make-your-own soft tacos that he'd bought from the cafeteria. They were one of his favorite lunches. He still had the ingredients for two more tacos, with the tortillas waiting on the side. I had an idea, but he wasn\u2019t going to be happy with it.\n\n\t\u201cGive me your tortillas,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d he said, shielding them with his arms.\n \t\u201cSoy, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Im gonna need your lunch.\u201d\n \t\u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s soft taco day,\u201d Soy replied sadly, \u201cmy third favorite day of the month.\u201d\n\n\t\u201cTrust me,\u201d I reassured him as he slowly slid them over. I was sure that if it was \u201cgrilled cheese day\u201d or \u201cpizza day\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t have been so lucky.\n\n\tIn a flash, I used the tortillas and our milk cartons to construct a small fort for the frog. The opening faced me, so that only I could see inside. Gently, I laid my lunch bag down nearby, showing the frog what I had built. \n\n\t\u201cListen,\u201d I whispered into the bag, \u201cwhen I say so, jump out into the fort. Okay?\u201d \n\nThere was no reply, but I was pretty sure that she had heard. Soy and I checked the surroundings one more time, trying to seem casual. The kids who were sitting closest to us had gotten up to talk to the girls sitting two tables over. Soy looked left, then right, and gave a nod. \n\n\t\u201cNow,\u201d I whispered. \n\n\tWith a quick green blur, the frog jumped from the bag to the taco-day-fort. When she turned around, I saw her glasses. It was her. \n\n\tShe spoke loud enough for Soy and me to hear, but nobody else. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat did the man in the bowtie ask you? What did he do to you?\u201d \n\n\t\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to me, but he did ask about you,\u201d I answered.\n \t\u201cReam has been on my tail for a while now,\u201d she said, testing the tortilla wall with her leg. \n\n\t\u201cFrogs don\u2019t have tails,\u201d said Soy.\n\n\tNobody respond. But it did make me realize something. \n\n\t\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about you. I don\u2019t even know your name yet,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cYou may call me Delilah, or Deli for short,\" she replied. Her face got much more serious (as serious as a frog\u2019s face can get). \u201cIt\u2019s very important that you tell me exactly what you told Ream. Can you do that?\u201d She asked. \n\n\t\u201cYes. I, well\u2026 I accidentally told him that you and I spoke. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, and meant it.\n \t\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\" Deli said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n \t\u201cThen he asked why you came to talk to me\u2026 Why did you come to talk to me?\u201d I asked. \n\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that now,\" she said. \"What did you tell him?\u201d\n \t\u201cI told him that Soy and I caught you by accident in the forrest, and that you were angry about it,\u201d I answered.\n \t\u201cBrilliant!\u201d she said. \"It probably won\u2019t hold him off for long, but it might confuse him. Then what happened?\u201d \n\n\t\u201cThen my mom saw that he had upset me and kicked him out straight away,\" I told Deli.\n \t\u201cOh, she did wonderfully! Your mom is a strong one, you know,\u201d she said. \n\n\tI wanted to know how she would know that, but there were other things that I wanted to know more. \n\n\t\u201cWho is he?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cThat,\u201d she said with a deep breath, \u201cis a complicated answer.\u201d\n \t\u201cHe\u2019s an alien, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asked Soy in an excited voice.\n \t\u201cNo, he\u2019s not an alien,\u201d Deli replied, but in a way that didn't make Soy feel silly for asking. It made me like her a bit more. \n\n\t\u201cCan you tell us who he is then?\u201d I asked.\n \tDeli paused for a while before answering. \u201cHe\u2019s a dragon,\u201d she said. \n\n\tI wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. I thought the word must mean something different than the one I knew.\n\n\t\u201cTechnically, he\u2019s the King of the Dragons,\u201d she added.\n \tSoy rolled his eyes. \n\n\t\u201cThanks for clearing that up,\u201d he said, \u201cI was going to guess unicorn.\u201d Deli couldn\u2019t see his eye roll, but Soy\u2019s tone made it clear that he thought she was delusional. \n \t\u201cYou mean like\u2026 a dragon-dragon?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cWait, maybe she meant dragonfly,\u201d interjected Soy, \u201clike this guy Ream must be the dreaded King of the Dragonflies!\u201d \n\n\tDeli wasn\u2019t amused. \n\n\t\u201cI mean dragons!\u201d she said firmly. \u201cAs in fire-breathing, hard-scaled, big-not-small dragons,\u201d she rebutted.\n \t\u201cBut...\u201d I said like I was breaking bad news, \u201cdragons aren\u2019t real.\" \n\n\tDeli brought one of her frog legs up to her head and smacked it.\n \t\u201cListen to me. There are things in this world that we don\u2019t know, until we do,\u201d she said. \n\n\tIt was a good point, and it was made by a talking frog. If we were arguing in a courtroom, that would have been her \u201cExhibit A\u201d. \n\n\t\u201cOkay, fair enough. But if dragons are real, then why hasn\u2019t anybody ever talked about them before?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cThey have. You can read about them in hundreds of books,\u201d she countered.\n \t\u201cYou mean like in fairytales?\u201d asked Soy as he raised his head above the fort, trying to peek in. \n\n\tBefore Deli could say another word, a hand hit the table and started tapping its nails. Soy and I froze. Deli tucked herself back under the cover of the fort as far as she could go. \n\n\t\u201cThe bell has rung, boys,\u201d said Miss Weaver. \u201cLunch is over, and Principal Lance would like to see you.\u201d \n\n\tI had completely forgotten about the bell, on account of the existence of dragons. Miss Weaver was not in a good mood. She always got that way when it was her turn to chaperone the lunch room. Probably because it cut into her shoulder pad naps. \n\n\t\"We\u2019re not done with our lunches, Miss Weaver,\u201d I said as politely as I could. \n\n\u201cThis looks more like play time than lunch! I can\u2019t have you building houses out of food,\u201d she said, struggling to find a reason, \u201cbecause... because then everyone would want to do it!\u201d \n\n\tSoy was nodding in agreement.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m already jealous of yours,\u201d he admitted.\n \tSuddenly, Miss Weaver was walking away to grab one of the garbage cans at the other end of the table. \n\n\t\u201cDeli!\u201d I whisper-shouted, \u201cshe\u2019s bringing a garbage can. You\u2019ve gotta hide!\u201d \n\n\tWithout a word, Deli leapt forward. A split-second later Miss Weaver turned around and dragged the trash can over to us. She used one arm to push all of our food into the can. That put Soy in a worse mood than Miss Weaver. His soft taco lunch was gone forever. Never to be eaten. \n\n\t\u201cGet moving. Don\u2019t keep Principal Lance waiting,\u201d said Miss Weaver. \n\n\tAt that moment, I didn\u2019t care about the principal or Miss Weaver. I cared about dragons, and the frog named Deli hiding inside my shirt. \n\n6. BATHROOM BREAK. \nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a better principal than Principal Lance. He had grey hair down to his shoulders, even though he was bald in the front. He was the oldest person at Stagwood, but he didn\u2019t act like it. I had never heard anyone say a bad word about him, and I wouldn\u2019t have either. Every year, on my birthday, he called me into his office and gave me a candy bar. I know he did the same for Soy (who usually finished his before he got back to the class and showed up with chocolate all over his face), and probably everyone else in my class. Still, he had a way of making me feel like I was more than some kid. \n\n\tPrincipal Lance\u2019s office was small and crowded, but friendly. He had stacks and stacks of dusty books that looked like they were hundreds of years old. I heard that a girl once sneezed on one of them by accident, and it blew away in pieces. The way the story goes, Principal Lance laughed so hard that he forgot why he had sent for her. But, as Soy and I walked into his office, it seemed less friendly than usual. Miss Weaver gave a small awkward bow and left us. As it turned out, Principal Lance wasn\u2019t alone. What I saw first in the chair next to us was a yellowish-gold bowtie, and then the large grin of Mr. Ream. My stomach dropped. \n\n\t\u201cHave a seat, kids,\u201d said Principal Lance. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, but Mr. Ream has insisted that he speak with you. And I insisted on being present. And so, with all this insisting going on, here we are!\u201d \n\n\tI always liked the way that Principal Lance explained things.\n\n\tDeli moved ever-so-slightly inside my shirt and I adjusted my posture without thinking. Ream\u2019s eyes shot towards me and narrowed. I had expected him to speak to me first, but he turned to Soy with a smile instead. \n\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met. Hello, Soy. My name is Mr. Ream,\u201d he said. \n\n\t\u201cHello. My name is Soy,\u201d said Soy.\n \t\u201cYes\u2026 as I said, hello, Soy,\u201d said Ream, already losing patience. \n\n\tSoy had a knack for making people lose their patience faster than anyone I\u2019d ever met. My dad called it \u201cimpressive\u201d, but my mom preferred not to talk about it. \n\n\t\u201cHello,\u201d said Soy a second time.\n \t\u201cSoy, do you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d asked Ream.\n \t\u201cNo. Do you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d Soy asked back.\n\n\tReam was about to lose his cool. He turned to Principal Lance. \n\n\t\u201cIf you would let me speak with them alone, we could be done with this much faster,\u201d Ream said.\n \t\u201cAs I\u2019ve told you, if you\u2019d like to speak with my students, you\u2019ll do it with me present,\u201d said Principal Lance. \n\n\t\u201cI\u2019m here as a representative of the school board,\u201d Ream said sternly.\n \t\u201cAnd I am here as caretaker to these children. Unless you are their parent or guardian, you may not speak to them without me present,\u201d Principal Lance said even more sternly. \n\n\tSoy\u2019s face was already covered in chocolate from a small bowl that Principal Lance had left unguarded. Ream looked over at Soy, shuddering at the thought of being his parent or guardian. \n\n\t\u201cThis will not be brought up in front of the children again,\u201d finished Principal Lance.  \n\n\t\u201cVery well,\u201d resigned Ream. \u201cSoy, I need to know if you\u2019ve noticed anything unusual in the past couple of days.\u201d \n\n\tTheir conversation was starting just like mine had, and that got me worried. The longer Ream questioned Soy or me, the more chances we would have to slip up again, even with Principal Lance there. I could still feel Deli inside my shirt, and I didn\u2019t want to think about what would happen if Ream got his hands on her. Or, if we believed Deli, his claws. \n\n\t\u201cSir, may I go to the bathroom?\u201d I blurted out. \n\n\t\u201cOf course,\u201d said Principal Lance. \n\n\tReam gave the slightest hint of a smile. He relished the idea of talking to Soy without me around. \n\n\t\u201cUm, also, I\u2019m not allowed to go without my bathroom pal,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cPardon?\u201d said Principal Lance.\n \t\"Miss Weaver told us that we have to go with a bathroom pal if we want to use the bathroom. I could get in a lot of trouble if she finds out that I went alone.\u201d I realized that I was learning how to think on my feet more and more since meeting Deli. It wasn\u2019t the greatest lie ever told, but I hoped it would do.\n\n\t\u201cBathroom pal? Seems a little unnecessary at your age. \u2018Bathroom buddy\u2019 has a nicer ring, anyway. Well, so be it. Go on then, Soy,\u201d said Principal Lance. \n\n\tI nudged Soy before he could object.\n \t\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d said Soy, \u201cI\u2019d better go with him. He always gets lost without me.\u201d \n\n\tSoy was the one who had walked into the girls' room by accident, not once, but twice that year already. But I wasn\u2019t about to argue with him. Not then, at least.\n\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t let them both go.\u201d said Mr. Ream. \u201cWhat if they...\u201d\n \t\u201cWhat if they run away?\u201d interrupted Principal Lance. \u201cWould you like me to disable their getaway car, just to be safe?\u201d he laughed. \u201cMr. Ream, when my students need to use the restroom, they use the restroom.\u201d \n\n\tHe rose and ushered us towards the door.\n \t\u201cAnd that goes for their bathroom pals, as well,\u201d he said, giving me the tiniest wink.\n\n\tAs we walked out, I could tell that Ream was upset, but he dared not argue against Principal Lance again. Ream knew that we were up to something, but, luckily for us, he didn\u2019t know what. Not-so-luckily for us, neither did I. \n\n\tLeading us through the brightly lit hallway, I didn\u2019t stop at the nearest bathroom. Instead, I kept walking, looking down at the green tiles under my feet, wondering what to do next. \n\n\t\"Where are we going?\u201d Soy asked. \n\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d  \n\n\tWe passed the library, then turned the corner and passed two more bathrooms: one for students and one for visitors. Either one would have done if I was actually looking for a bathroom. At the moment, the last place I wanted us to be was somewhere that Ream expected us to be. If there was a book called \u201cDealing with Dragons\u201d, I was pretty sure Chapter One would be: \u201cDon\u2019t Tell the Dragon Exactly Where You\u2019re Going then Corner Yourself\u201d, or something like that. \n\n\tAfter turning the corner to an empty hall, I stopped. If we were going to figure this out, we\u2019d need Deli\u2019s help.\n\n\t\u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d I whispered to Deli inside my shirt. \n \t\u201cYou need to get to your home,\u201d Deli answered, \u201cit\u2019s not safe here anymore.\u201d \n\n\t\"What\u2019s she saying?\u201d asked Soy.\n \t\"She said we need to get to my house,\" I told him.\n \t\"What\u2019s at your house?\u201d he asked me.\n \t\"What\u2019s at my house?\u201d I asked Deli. \n\n\tA mop splashed onto the floor, and my head flew up to see the custodian, Mr. Salazar, staring at me. \n\n\t\"I sometimes talk to my belly button. Sometimes,\u201d I stammered at him.\n\n\t\u201cMe too,\u201d said Soy without skipping a beat.\n \tHe pulled his shirt away from his body, stuck his head down, and said, \u201cHey, little guy, come on out and say hi!\u201d \n\n\tSoy\u2019s bellybutton was sometimes an innie and sometimes an outtie, so I wondered if this was actually a conversation that he'd had with it before. Mr. Salazar shook his head, and continued mopping in the other direction.\n\n\tI didn\u2019t want to risk running into anyone else, so we snuck into the empty auditorium across the hall. When I got inside, I remembered that there was an exit behind the stage that would lead us straight into the woods. During play rehearsals, when the auditorium got too hot, they opened the door and let the breeze in. \u201cNo sense wasting money on air conditioning,\u201d Miss Weaver would say. She was the self-appointed director every year since she, \u201cknew how to deal with stars.\u201d \n\n\tI was pretty familiar with the stage area. Not only had I been the (first actually) Weeping Willow, I had also been a stagehand. Soy knew a little about the stage, too. He had tried out for the lead once, but was given the role of a crocodile instead. Despite that, he ended up being mentioned in every single review, although indirectly. \u201cWas the crocodile supposed to talk?\u201d, and \u201cWhy did it have an accent?\u201d were two of his favorites.\n\n\tNow, the stage exit was our best shot at escaping without being seen.\n\n\t\u201cThis way,\u201d I said, hurrying down the side aisle. \n\n\tThe set for the next play was still being built. There was a fake forest, and a small hut with pieces of wood scattered all around it. I hadn\u2019t paid attention to what the production was, since deciding not to try out again. Soy had gotten a lifetime ban* for his crocodile performance and it wouldn\u2019t have been much fun without him. \n\n*Soy had told me that he outgrew the theater. It wasn\u2019t until I saw \u201cBANNED FROM THE THEATER\u201d posters with his face on them that I found out the truth.\n\n\tI let Deli out onto the stage, and then Soy and I hopped up after her. The glowing red exit sign was in sight when we passed the hut, but a loud noise from the front of the auditorium stopped us in our tracks.\n\n\t\u201cGet down!\u201d yelled Deli.\n\n\tWe crouched behind the flat wooden hut. Deli instinctively crouched too, which I thought was strange. Then I saw the terrible news for myself through a window in the hut. It was Ream, and he was being escorted down the center aisle by Mr. Salazar. \n\n\t\u201cThey came in here. They were acting all odd, talking to their tummies,\u201d said Mr. Salazar.\n \t\u201cHmm, I see. Thank you, that will be all,\u201d Ream said with a wave of his hand. \n\n\t\u201cWho did you say you worked for again?\u201d asked the custodian. \n\n\t\u201cThe school board. The one that decides your salary,\u201d replied Ream as he strode down the aisle towards us. \n\n\tMr. Salazar mumbled something I couldn\u2019t hear and left the auditorium. Ream was looking down each row of seats as he approached. When he was halfway down, he started speaking. \n\n\t\u201cI know that you\u2019re in here,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cIs he talking to us?\u201d whispered Soy.\n \t\u201cWe need to get out of here!\u201d said Deli.\n \t\u201cHe\u2019ll see us if we run for the exit,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cOkay, then\u2026 we need to find a way to make him angry!\u201d she whispered. \n\n\t\"If he really is a dragon, is that such a good idea?\u2019 asked Soy.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s the only way. Trust me,\u201d said Deli. \n\n\tI looked around the set. I\u2019d never set out to make an adult angry before (especially one that worked for the school), but this was cause for an exception. My eyes settled on a handwritten sign that I had seen many times before, attached to the switch beside us. It read: DO NOT TOUCH.\n\n\t\"I know how,\u201d I said shakily, \u201cbut he\u2019ll need to get closer.\u201d \n\n\t\u201cNot a problem,\u201d whispered Soy. \n\n\tReam vaulted up onto the stage, apparently finished searching the seats. He was the tallest person I\u2019d ever seen. If we didn\u2019t do something soon, he would find us in seconds. \n\n\t\u201cI knew he was hiding something. You\u2019ve been following these two for a weeks now, haven\u2019t you Delilah? Have you finally found him?\u201d Ream asked with a villainous grin. \n\n\tSoy was about to ask a question, but Deli quieted him with one look. Ream was ten feet away, right where the set began. \n\n\t\u201cWhatever you\u2019re going to do, do it now!\u201d she whispered. \n\n\tI lunged to the side, tore through the warning sign and flipped the switch. Ream turned his head towards me with a sinister snarl. There was a loud crack from above the stage. A wave of red came crashing down on Ream's head, covering him and the ground completely. I was in shock. The curtain had fallen directly on him, just as I had planned, but seeing it happen startled me.\n\n\t\u201cDo you think I hurt him?\u201d I asked.\n \tI approached the pile slowly, but Deli jumped in front. \n\n\t\u201cNo! We have to go now!\u201d she exclaimed. \n\n\tThe pile began to rise from the center. It kept growing until it almost reached the ceiling. \t\t\t\n\n        In a burst, the curtain was split in two by sharp claws. There, standing in front of us, was the King of the Dragons. \n\n7. DRAGON BREATH.\n\t\u201cHOW DARE YOU!\u201d said the dragon in a booming voice. His scales were bright yellow and shiny (almost glistening). His wings expanded and blocked out the rest of the auditorium. He took a step forward and I felt the stage shake beneath us. He was more terrifying than any dragon I had ever seen in drawings. His head alone was larger than my whole body. \t\n\n\tReam breathed a heavy breath and then let out a puff of steam that blew over me and Deli. Soy was still tucked down behind the hut, but I knew he felt it too. \n\n\t\"Go!\u201d yelled Deli as she jumped between my legs to lead the way. \n\nThe three of us sprinted toward the exit door. Soy charged through first, and as Deli and I ran behind him, I felt more of the steam. This time it was much hotter. I slammed the door shut behind us and we ran as fast as we could to the tree line. We kept running until the school was out of sight. We stumbled over logs and under branches. Soy and I both fell at least twice, but Deli seemed to weave through the trees perfectly with every jump. When we were deep in the woods, Deli finally told us that it was okay to walk for a minute. \n\n\t\u201cHe\u2019ll have to hide in the auditorium until he can take human form again. It takes much more effort to build a disguise than to let your true form show,\u201d she explained.\n \t\u201cThat was a DRAGON!\u201d yelled Soy, catching his breath.\n \t\u201cI don\u2019t understand what just happened,\u201d I muttered. \n\n\tDeli replied, \u201cListen boys, I know this is a lot to take in, but it\u2019s time that you started believing me. It will make this a lot easier.\" \n\n\tNot running anymore had helped me to calm down and think a little more clearly. \n\n\t\u201cDid you know that he was going to do that? Change like that?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cI was counting on it,\u201d she said.\n \t\u201cThat was pretty risky, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Soy asked angrily. \u201cEspecially since he would\u2019ve passed right over you and gone for the main course!\u201d \n\n\tWe found the worn dirt path that led to my neighborhood. It was quiet in the woods, except for a few birds chirping overhead in a strange whistle.\n\n\t\u201cWhat happened when you flicked that switch?\u201d Deli asked me.\n \t\u201cThat curtain\u2019s been broken for two years. Miss Weaver told Mr. Salazar to fix it, but he just put up a sign instead. She doesn\u2019t mind because without a curtain falling she can bow as many times as she wants to when the play is over.\u201d\n \t\u201cMiss Weaver finally did something right, then,\u201d said Deli. \n\nI stopped in my tracks. \n\n\t\u201cHow is it that you know Miss Weaver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd what did Ream mean back there when he asked you if you\u2019ve found \u2018him\u2019?\u201d \n\n\tSoy stopped walking, too. \n\n\tDeli replied, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll explain. But keep walking. We still need to get to your house, and it\u2019s another five minutes away.\u201d \n\n\tI almost asked how she knew that, but decided not to bother. \n\n\tShe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Stagwood for a long time. My job was to find the hero before Ream did.\u201d\n \t\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018the hero\u2019?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cAbout twelve years ago, a hero was born here in Stagwood,\u201d she answered. \n\n\t\u201cI was born in Stagwood twelve years ago!\u201d said Soy. \n\n\t\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Deli responded. I could feel her looking at me as she spoke, but I got real interested in the colorful leaves at my feet instead. \n\n\t\u201cDo you know who the hero is?\u201d I stared harder at the fallen leaves. \n\n\t\u201cWe know that it\u2019s a boy,\u201d she said.\n \t\u201cWell, duh,\u201d interrupted Soy with a proud smile, \u201caren\u2019t most heroes?\u201d \n\n\t\u201cActually, no. About 51% of heroes are female and 5% are non-binary. The males just seem to brag a lot more about it,\u201d Deli explained with a smaller, but louder smile.\n \t\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d Soy sometimes started a sentence without knowing how to end it. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cAs I mentioned, we know that he was born here in Stagwood, and we also know that it was in the summer,\u201d she answered.\n \t\u201cRight, and I was born in June. I think we\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s me,\u201d said Soy.\n \t\u201cAnd when were you born?\u201d she asked me. \n\n\tMy stare pierced the leaves and was well on its way to the center of the earth. \u201cJuly,\u201d I mumbled.\n \t\u201cGuys, guys, guys. It\u2019s me,\u201d said Soy with a hand on my shoulder, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a hero, you can just\u2026 feel it.\u201d\n \t\u201cFor years we weren\u2019t sure who the hero was, because not much else had been written about him,\u201d Deli told us.\n \u201cWritten? By who?\u201d I asked. \n\n\tNearby, a woodpecker was knocking on a tree. I couldn\u2019t see where it was, but Deli had noticed the sound, too. \n\n\t\u201cThe fairies write down the stories. The battles between good and evil, darkness and light, and magic and sorcery are all found in the fairytales,\u201d she said.\n \t\u201cFairies?\u201d I asked, looking at Deli.\n \t\u201cOf course.\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re called fairytales. Fairy\u2019s tales. Who did you think wrote them?\u201d \n\n\t\u201cPeople!\u201d answered Soy.\n \tDeli responded, \u201cPeople can\u2019t write the way that fairies do. Fairies are able to be places without being seen, and to know what is happening as it happens. They are the first and true storytellers.\u201d \n\n\t\u201cWait, are you saying\u2026 those stories are real?\u201d I thought out loud.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d said Deli, \u201cas I was trying to tell you before, the creatures you\u2019ve read about are real, and so are their adventures. And the hero of this story has the most important adventure of all ahead of them.\u201d \n\n\t\"So what is it that the hero has to do? I should probably know before I get started with my heroicalisms,\u201d Soy boasted.\n \t\u201cHeroics.\u201d I corrected. \u201cAnd this adventure sounds kind of dangerous.\u201d\n \tDeli\u2019s eyes became serious behind her glasses. \u201cYes. He must face the gravest of foes.\u201d \n\n\tSoy had lost his smile. He lowered his eyes, choosing rocks to stare at instead of leaves. \u201cFoe, like an evil gnome?\u201d\n \t\u201cAfraid not. More like a dragon,\" she replied.\n \tSoy and I looked at each other. \u201cYou mean Ream? He\u2019s part of the fairytale?\u201d I asked.\n \tDeli nodded. \u201cPerhaps he wasn\u2019t always meant to be, but he is now.\u201d She looked at the trees above us.\n \t\u201cGuys, I\u2019ve thought a lot about it, and I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m the hero,\u201d said Soy definitively.\n \tDeli smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Soy,\u201d she said. \"After years of searching, I believe I\u2019ve found him.\u201d\n \t\u201cAnd who is it?\u201d asked Soy. \n\n\tDeli shot a glance behind us towards the path.\n\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s no time for that now,\u201d she said. \u201cReam has spies all over these woods and we\u2019ve taken too long. Unless my ears are deceiving me, they\u2019re getting closer. It\u2019s time to get inside.\u201d Deli sprinted ahead with long jumps.\n \tSoy whispered in my ear, \u201cOkay, maybe they do have a neck, but now she\u2019s talking about ears? Seriously, Deli has no idea how to frog.\u201d\n\n8.  LAUNCH.\nWe ran the rest of the way to my house, which didn\u2019t take more than a minute. Once we were inside, Soy started to make a snack from the fridge. This was despite the fact that ever since the \u201cMidnight Sleepover Snack Incident of 2012\u201d, Soy was only allowed to take food from a special drawer labeled: FOOD THIEF.\n\n \n\nMy mom had woken up that fateful morning to find our kitchen in shambles. At first she blamed my dad, then what she estimated must have been fifteen raccoons, and then, finally, Soy. He was sprawled out on a pile of containers and wrappers (and not nearly enough napkins) when my mother came for him. \u201cWorth it,\u201d was all he had the energy to say.\n\n \n\nAfterwards, my parents and Soy\u2019s made an arrangement to give Soy his own drawer and only stock healthy food inside. That\u2019s also the reason that I never once saw him open it. Sometimes I ate from it to help cover for him.\n\n \n\n\u201cSoy, now\u2019s not the time for food,\u201d I said, shutting the fridge.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right,\u201d said Deli. \"Soy, I want you to gather as much food as you can carry inside both of your backpacks and then bring them upstairs. Anything you want, okay?\u201d\n\n \n\nSoy was too shocked to speak. It was like she had just asked if he would mind testing every toy in the toy store. He nodded (and drooled a little).\n\nI picked up Deli and ran up the stairs to my room. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re here. Now what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNow we get ready for liftoff,\u201d she said. \u201cOpen that window as far as it will go.\u201d \n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I said.\n\nI ran over to the window across from my bed and dresser, pulled up the blinds and lifted the glass as high as I could manage.\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t do it,\u201d she told me, \u201cget it higher.\u201d\n\nI used a baseball bat to get an extra two feet and built a base out of three books and an empty glass to hold it up. Deli gave me a little frog nod.\n\nI ran back over to her and asked, \u201cWhat else do you need for, wait\u2026 liftoff?\u201d\n\nSoy had to drag the backpacks into my room. By the time he got to us, his smile looked like it hurt.\n\n \n\n\u201cGreat work, Soy!\u201d Deli said. \u201cNow lift them up onto the bed.\u201d\n\nAs Soy heaved the bags up one at a time, I heard crinkles and clinking and sloshing. My guess was that Soy must\u2019ve taken absolutely everything in the kitchen except for the contents of his drawer.\n\n\"Do you have a smartphone?\" Deli asked me.\n\n \n\nI opened my desk drawer and pulled out a dark blue smartphone. It was a birthday gift from my mom. The cover was custom-made with a picture of me at three years old with spaghetti all over my face. I was pretty positive she had glued it on.\n\nEven though I had the phone, my parents didn\u2019t really let me use it much. They told me it was only for emergencies, and they made sure to check the bill every month. On top of that, they looked at my text message history every week, just to be sure I wasn\u2019t using it improperly. Once, I used it to vote for my favorite singer on a reality show. When my parents found out, they grounded me for three weeks. They let me off the hook after two weeks, but I never got to see the finale.\n\n \n\n\u201cNow, hop on the bed,\u201d said Deli.\n\nAll three of us sat in a row facing the window, with Soy in the back with our bags, Deli in the center, and me at the foot of the bed.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Soy asked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to fly this bed out of the room,\u201d she answered.\n\nSoy was silent for a moment. \u201cI decided I\u2019m not asking any more questions,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cHow are you going to make a bed fly?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d I asked with a squeak. \u201cBut I\u2019m\u2026 I can\u2019t even drive yet!\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, your bed already has the magic that you need to make it fly,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve slept in this bed every night, and it\u2019s never once flown,\u201d I rebutted quickly, before Soy could accuse me of holding out on him.\n\n \n\nDeli explained, \u201cThere is a magic in the stories your parents read to you when you were younger, and the ones you read to yourself. It\u2019s a form of magic called lore. Most of it goes to you and helps fuel your dreams. Some of it, though, falls around you, building up inside your bed.\u201d\n\nSoy was staring at her blankly.\n\nShe continued, \"Imagine a single flower in a field of dry grass. If you watered that flower every single day, not only would the flower bloom and grow, but the grass surrounding it would become green and strong, as well. Your bed has been sprinkled with lore, growing stronger every night. Now it\u2019s time to use it.\u201d\n\nI had never heard of lore before and, from the look on his face, neither had Soy. He shook his head as he opened a bag of chips.\n\n\u201cNope. Nope. Nope. What you\u2019re looking for is an airplane. This is a bed.\u201d He took a bite and made a loud crunch. \u201cI do sleep on both of them, though,\u201d he said to himself.\n\nI put my hand on top of the blanket for a moment. Maybe it was time that I started to trust Deli. She had warned us that Mr. Ream was a dragon, and there was no denying that now. She had helped us escape and had risked her own skin more than once. If she said my bed could fly, maybe she was right.\n\n \n\n\u201cOkay, what do I need to do?\u201d I inquired. \n\n\u201cWharffs??\u201d Soy said with a mouth full of chips.\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Deli responded, \u201cFirst things first, pick your steering wheel. It can be anything you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\nI picked up the smallest pillow on my bed. It was one that my grandfather had made for me when I was little. It was dark grey with an apple tree sewn onto the front of it. \n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPlace it in front of you,\u201d she told me.\n\n \n\nI put both my hands on the pillow in front of me, acting like it was a steering wheel. Without a noise, I felt it lock into place. I could rotate it around, but when I pushed or pulled it too far, it snapped back into position. When I let go, it hung midair. It was like it was held in place by invisible rubber bands.\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d I said, turning back to Soy, \u201care you seeing this?\u201d He nodded with wide eyes.\n\n\u201cThat will do nicely. Items with meaning tend to absorb more lore,\u201d she told me. Soy was starting to creep up to watch more closely.\n\n\u201cNow, place your phone down,\u201d she instructed me.\n\n \n\nI put the phone down on the bed to my left, next to the steering wheel, and it stuck there. The smartphone glowed orange, and the screen began to change. There were all sorts of gauges and levels on the screen that I had never seen before. Most prominent, were five buttons:\n\n \n\nCRUISE MODE \n\nSPY MODE \n\nSQUEEZE \n\nNEVER PUSH\n\nand the largest, LIFTOFF.\n\n \n\nI was so nervous and excited that I didn\u2019t realize my mom had come home until I heard the door slam shut.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d she yelled upstairs. \u201cWas it a half-day today?\u201d\n\nShe had seen the books from our backpacks that were emptied onto the kitchen floor when Soy made room for the food.\n\nDeli started to speak faster. \u201cDo you see the LIFTOFF button? Press it now.\u201d\n\nI pushed the button and the mattress immediately began to shake. And then, slowly, it lifted itself up into the air. It was only a few inches off of the frame when it stopped shaking and hovered smoothly. My face gave way to an involuntary smile. Of all the things that I had seen and experienced that day, this was the most amazing. We were flying!\n\n \n\nMy smile was cut short when we heard the sound of cabinet doors opening and closing with loud bangs.\n\n\u201cHe did it again!\u201d she yelled. \u201cHe ate it all!\u201d\n\nMy mom immediately started storming up the stairs, speaking to herself. \u201cThis time Soy\u2019s going to replace everything he took! How did he even\u2026 No, I don\u2019t care how! He\u2019s going to be punished!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for proper instructions,\u201d Deli panicked. \"Push the brown button and tilt the steering wheel forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but it -\u201d I began to say.\n\nMy mom knocked angrily on my door and then started to turn the knob.\n\n \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time, just do it!\u201d Deli shouted.\n\nI pushed my finger down hard onto the brown button, labeled: SQUEEZE.\n\nThe sides of the bed shot up towards our heads, wrapping us up. The door started to swing open. I had just enough room to push my hands forward on the pillow. In the blink of an eye, we shot straight ahead, pushed through the window, knocking the bat away, and popping us out the other side as it shut.\n\n \n\nI could barely hear my mom shouting when she opened the door to an empty room. \u201cBeds?!? He\u2019s taking beds now?!\u201d\n\n9. FLIGHT OF THE BED. \nOur house sat on forest end of Windfall Drive. There were eleven-and-a-half houses on our side of the street and twelve on the other. The \u201chalf\u201d was because of a house on the opposite end of the block, at the intersection with Slope Street. It was owned by two elderly ladies, both named Miss Trinket. They were identical twins and didn\u2019t seem to like anyone, least of all each other. Miss Trinket got her mail addressed to Windfall Drive and her sister, Miss Trinket, insisted on getting her mail addressed to Slope Street. According to my dad, it all started forty years ago with an argument over who should mow the lawn. \n\n\u201cMiss Trinket doesn\u2019t think she should have to do it because Miss Trinket has slightly longer legs than her, and it would take her less time. However, Miss Trinket thinks Miss Trinket should do it because she has a bad back and Miss Trinket doesn\u2019t. Ever since the argument started, they refuse to live at the same address, so Miss Trinket changed hers to Slope Street. Understand?\u201d my dad asked. My answer was always no, no matter how matter times he explained it. \n\nSometimes their grass would get so long that Soy refused to walk by. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s inside there?!\u201d he would say. Most likely it was just bugs and maybe snakes, and Soy liked both of them. Still something about not being able to see inside rubbed Soy the wrong way, so we took the long way around or went through the woods instead. Besides that, there was always a Miss Trinket outside on the porch waiting to get mad about something. They yelled at the mailman every single day for scaring their dog, Marshall. He was a small border collie with white and black hair, and he was always laying down next to one of them. I sometimes wondered if he could tell them apart. If animals really could talk, that might have been my first question.\n\nOnce a summer, my dad sent me over to mow their lawn for them, secretly hoping to make our side of the street an even twelve again (he said that the other side of the street looked down on us). Mowing their lawn didn\u2019t make our street whole, but it did make me the only person who the Trinket Twins liked. \n\nThey would each make me a lemonade if it was a hot day, and deliver it to me when the other one wasn\u2019t around. One of the Trinkets made hers too sweet and the other made hers too tart, but when I combined them the lemonade tasted perfect. The best part was that they always paid me separately, as well.\n \t\u201cRemember, I\u2019m the nice one,\u201d a Miss Trinket would say as she handed me money. \n\nTwo minutes later the other Miss Trinket would say the same thing and hand me the same amount of money. I decided that they were both the nice one, partly because it was true but mostly because I had no way of picking.\n\nFlying on my bed, we rocketed down the middle of Windfall Drive, past twelve houses to our left, and eleven and a half to our right. Luckily for us, there was only one person outside that day, and it was a Miss Trinket, with Marshall by her side. She was sitting on her porch, looking out over a foot of grass with a lemonade in her hand, either too sweet or too tart.\n\nMarshall lifted his head and wagged his tail as he looked up. Miss Trinket gave me a friendly smile and wave as we zipped by her. I waved back as best as I could from the smushed bed. She put a finger over her mouth to tell me that she knew how to keep a secret, and gave a wink. Say what you will about a Miss Trinket, but they\u2019re a pretty good person to have on your side when you\u2019re flying down the street on a magic bed and don\u2019t want it getting back to your mom. \n\nFlying was like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before. It was like being on a roller coaster that jumped its tracks and decided to explore. My excitement changed to worry when I spotted the bookstore getting closer and closer. I\u2019d forgotten that my street ended abruptly at Finnegan's Books, and we were running out of road. It looked like a house, but it was one story taller than all the others. \n\n\u201cPress the button again!\u201d shouted Deli from behind me. \n\nI found the smartphone, at eye level now, but it was too close to my face to see. I shimmied and nudged my elbows until I could just make out the words. The brown button now read: FLOPBACK. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a second to spare as I pushed it. The mattress flattened out in an instant. I lifted the pillow steering wheel slightly, now that it was moving more easily, and we shot up higher. The bookstore was passing safely below us when Soy spoke. \n\n\u201cHow are you so good at steering?\u201d he asked me.\n \t\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, looking back. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what feels right.\u201d \n\nDeli seemed to be smiling, but it can be hard to tell sometimes with frogs. \n\nThe sky was clear blue as far as I could see. I saw the wind blowing crumbs off of Soy\u2019s shirt. We were flying faster and higher by the second. \n\n\u201cKeep climbing,\u201d said Deli. \n\nI steered the bed upward until I could see all of Stagwood Forest below us. To the west, it thinned out and faded into the slope of Saltridge Hills. The forest was thicker to our right, where it spread until hitting Merrywater Creek. \n\nI decided to test out the bed a little more. Better to learn how to fly it when there was nothing else around. I turned the pillow to the right, and the whole bed started to fly right. I turned the pillow slightly left, and we shifted back. When I pushed forward, the bed sped up and the wind blew through my hair, making my cheeks flap. I pulled towards me, and we slowed down, which made the bed begin to dip. Lifting and pushing and forward, we floated right back up. \n\nI was so intent on learning that I barely felt the tap on my shoulder. When I turned around, I saw that Soy\u2019s face had turned green, and it looked like he was about to throw up. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to get car sick,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a car,\u201d reminded Deli. \n\nSoy didn\u2019t have time for a rebuttal. He got sick over the side of the bed. I concentrated on keeping the bed straight from then on. \n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I shouted, so he could hear me over his vomiting. \n\nA few moments later he was laying back on the bed. \u201cYou can\u2019t zigzag around like that!\u201d he scolded me. \u201cI almost fell off the bed!\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Soy,\u201d I answered.\n\nI felt pretty bad about making him sick, but it felt much worse to think that I had endangered all of us.\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to be going?\u201d I asked Deli, to change the subject.\n\nShe hopped over to the phone and looked at the screen. I watched her leg stretch out and press the button that said: CRUISE MODE. A map application came up that looked like one my parents used on their phones all the time. She typed out the word \u201cPAVIDALE\u201d, and entered it. \n\nThe pillow popped out of my hands and dropped, attaching itself to the bed. All of a sudden, a see-through bright orange shield started to rise from all sides of the bed. It locked together above our heads. We were completely encased. \n\n\u201cLuckily, your bed has more than enough lore to spare for the shield, too. It will make sure that nobody falls off,\u201d Deli told us happily. \u201cAnd Soy, if you need to throw up again, let me know, because you don\u2019t want the shield up when you do.\u201d\n \t\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to... Pardivale?\u201d I blurted out. \n\n\u201cPavidale. Yes. Right now, it\u2019s over Iceland,\u201d she told me. \n\n\u201cRight now?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cRight now,\u201d she said and left it at that. \u201cThe bed knows where to go. It will take care of the rest. But remember this: the shield is better at keeping things in than keeping things out, so pay attention to anything that might get in our path. Take back control anytime by pressing the CRUISE MODE button again to turn it off.\u201d \n\nSoy reached his arms out wide and looked around. \u201cWhat could we possibly hit out here?\u201d\n \t\u201cBirds for one thing, planes for another\u2026 or dark clouds. Those would be the worst of all,\u201d she answered gravely. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about dark clouds?\u201d I asked Deli. I had a feeling that we wouldn\u2019t like her answer. \n\n\u201cDark clouds can be a source of a magic that we call rile. Rile is the opposite of lore. It fuels nightmares, and it gives the worst kind of creatures their magic. There\u2019s no telling what we\u2019d find inside if we passed through a cloud with rile,\u201d she said.\n \t\u201cOkay,\u201d I interjected, \u201cbut we learned in school that clouds are just water vapor. And that they\u2019re white because of something to do with how they scatter light.\u201d\n \t\u201cWe learned that?\u201d Soy asked.\n \t\u201cAnd that dark clouds, or rain clouds, are only dark because they have more water inside,\u201d I finished.\n \t\u201cWhen did we learn that?!\u201d Soy questioned.\n \t\u201cLast week. That\u2019s why you should pay better attention in class sometimes,\u201d I responded proudly.\n \t\u201cAnd you looked out the window, saw a frog with glasses, and have us flying away from a dragon on your bed. That\u2019s why you should pay attention in class.\"\n\nSoy must\u2019ve been saving that one up. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how most clouds work,\u201d said Deli, \u201cbut these clouds are different. They don\u2019t operate by the same rules, just like a dream doesn\u2019t operate by the same rules as the real world. Lore and rile are stronger than you can possibly imagine.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do we know a dark magic cloud from a regular one?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cMagic clouds take the shape of something unusual. Extraordinary even,\u201d she answered. \n\nSoy and I both looked around the sky. There were no clouds around with interesting shapes. And I still had more questions. \n\n\u201cDeli, if there are clouds with rile inside, does that mean that there are clouds with lore inside too?\u201d \n\nDeli smiled back at me.\n \t\u201cThat is an excellent question,\u201d she said.\n \tThe bed dipped a few feet, riding on an air current that was invisible to me. \n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t have to tell you,\u201d she said, lying back, \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to find out soon enough.\u201d \n\nDeli took over a little while later, patrolling the sky until the sun began to set. She told Soy and me to get some sleep while we could, so we\u2019d be rested. I tried to remember whether frogs were nocturnal or not. Then I wondered whether it mattered, since Deli said she wasn\u2019t a real frog. Those were my last thoughts before drifting off to sleep. \n\nI hadn\u2019t had a nightmare in a long time, but that night I did. I dreamt about big red dragons who were attacking me from the sky and from underground. And then I dreamt about the shape I had been drawing in class when Deli appeared. I didn\u2019t recognize what it was then, and I didn\u2019t even know why I drew it. It felt like maybe I had dreamt of that shape once before, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. Then the shape was floating right above me, but just as I reached out to grab it, Deli woke me. She thought she had seen something following behind us. After we looked more closely, we decided that it was nothing. \n\n\u201cProbably just a plane passing by,\u201d she concluded. \n\nI went back to sleep easily. The rest of the night I dreamt of flying around the world on top of an enormous marshmallow. It was much nicer than the dragon dream. By the time the sun rose, we were almost there. I didn\u2019t let on to Deli and Soy, but I knew almost nothing about Iceland. When we first caught a glimpse of it, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I thought it was the most amazing place that I had ever seen. There were big green mountains and hills with snow on top. We flew over huge lakes and waterfalls cut into the side of rocks, and the air smelled nicer than any air from back home. \n\n\u201cThis reminds me of Scotland!\u201d Soy said. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Scotland?\u201d I asked him. \n\n\u201cYep, my whole family went when I was a baby,\u201d he replied proudly.\n \t\u201cHow can you possibly remember it then? I can\u2019t remember a thing about being a baby,\u201d I said. \n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cSome babies are smarter than others.\u201d \n\nI took my position at the head of the bed, and Deli jumped up beside me. \u201cPress the CRUISE MODE button again,\u201d she commanded. \n\nRight after I pressed it, the bed started to shake. The orange shield receded slowly, and I felt the temperature drop. The pillow popped up into my hands, and I grabbed it, doing my best to steady the bed. Deli pointed to a large cloud which was now directly in front of us. I noticed that it was in an odd shape: long in the body, but still thick, and there was a wisp of cloud coming out of the top. \n\nSoy recognized it before I did. \u201cIt\u2019s a whale!\u201d he shouted. \n\nI steered the bed upward, heading for the tail. We followed the curve and headed up the back. I had underestimated how fast we were going and we passed right over most of the body in a few seconds. \n\nWe were almost at the head when Deli yelled, \u201cDrop us down!\u201d \n\nI pulled down hard on the pillow, and we broke through the top edge of the cloud, just a little past the blowhole. There was a flash of white, and I felt a cool wet breeze. A split-second later I felt warm, like it was a spring day. The white surrounding us turned to open space, and I realized that this cloud was hollow. \n\nI looked down and saw green, speckled with small squares, and there were shapes moving around in-between them on tan lines. There was also a blue circle. My brain searched, trying to match what I was seeing with everything I knew about clouds. But it was somewhere else in my head that I found the answer. What I saw reminded me of a map. I was looking at a village. \n\nWe were falling faster and longer than I\u2019d ever fallen before. My stomach felt like it was inside my throat. I tried yanking up on the pillow, but it was not responding to my touch; it felt like there was something stronger controlling it. As we got closer to the bottom, lights flew up from below us and began whizzing by the bed. \n\n\u201cDo something!\u201d yelled Soy, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die inside a whale cloud!\u201d\n \tDeli hadn\u2019t moved since we started dropping. She looked as calm as ever. \n\nThe back of the bed hit first, and then the front came crashing down. To my surprise, water shot up from all sides and splashed down onto my head. \n\n\u201cWelcome to Pavidale,\u201d Deli announced.\n\n10. PAVIDALE. \nThe water was clear and blue, and when I peeked over the side of the bed, I saw strange fish swimming below us. They had long snouts and small fins, and most of them were purple and yellow. The fish were sprinting through tubes made of something spongy and, every once in awhile, they would jump above the water and do a flip. We were in a small pond. The bank had bright emerald grass and a group of houses that were the size of dog houses, but fancy as mansions.\n\nAt the far edge of the pond was a flat stone with dozens of glowing lights dancing around on top of it. They were the same lights that had flown by us during my \u201clanding\u201d. They were moving in a way that even the best holiday lights in the world couldn\u2019t.\n \t\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we sinking?\u201d asked Soy. \n\nBefore he got an answer, the bed started to float towards the stone platform. I got a closer look at the lights and realized that they weren\u2019t just lights. They looked human, with one big difference: they had wings that were more incredible than any I\u2019ve ever drawn.\n\n\u201cAre those over-sized fireflies?\u201d Soy asked.\n \t\u201cThose are fairies,\u201d I said with certainty.\n \t\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Deli, \u201cPavidale is the home of the fairies.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you ever do or say anything normal?\u201d Soy asked. \n\nThe fairies wings were glowing brightly, and you could almost see right through them. Their ears were tall and pointy on both sides of their long faces. Each fairy had its own colorful glow, and they all hummed with excitement as we drifted closer. Without a sound, the bed tapped the edge of the stone. \n\nI guessed that the fairies must be about six inches tall. Almost all of them were a shade of green or blue, but there were a few yellow and red ones, too. There was only one pink fairy, and their glow was stronger than any of the others. The pink fairy stepped forward from the crowd. \n\n\u201cAllow me to introduce, Tryt,\u201d Deli said as she gestured toward the pink fairy.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Tryt,\u201d Soy said, bowing his head low behind me.\n \t\u201cWe have waited a long time for your arrival. Although, I had hoped that you both would have learned some manners by now. Just because a fairy is pink does not mean that it is female,\u201d Tryt said. \n\nSoy picked his head up and blushed. As we stepped off the bed onto the stone, the fairies swarmed us. They fluttered and giggled, and gossiped in whispers. \n\n\u201cCome now,\u201d commanded Tryt, \u201cleave them be. They\u2019ve traveled far, and there\u2019s much to do before they leave.\u201d \n\nI wasn\u2019t ready to think about leaving anytime soon. I had never seen any place like Pavidale. There was something magical and comforting and serene about it. We followed Tryt down a wide tan road. He flew low to the ground, at the same height as Deli\u2019s hops. \n\nTryt had a regal look about him. He wore a magnificent clear robe that glimmered (with holes in the back for his wings). Somehow he always seemed to be talking down to us, even when he was speaking from a few feet below. \n\n\u201cThere were some fairies here who were beginning to wonder if you\u2019d ever find him,\u201d he said to Deli.\n \t\u201cYes, it\u2019s just that, I needed to be certain,\u201d she responded meekly.\n \tAfter a long pause, Tryt spoke again. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t fail with so much at stake.\u201d \n\nTryt led us to a circular building much larger than the houses, with pillars and some letters above the entrance that I did not recognize. As we walked through, I discovered there was no roof in the center, just an open garden with a round table and four chairs that looked like they were made of glass. \n\n\u201cThe pond fairies will take care of your bed. Although I must say, we did not expect you to land so abruptly,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHave a seat and let us get down to business.\" \n\nTryt showed each of us to our chairs around the table. Soy was to my right, and Tryt was to my left, with Deli straight across. I noticed that the chairs were made of a hard material, but they were still comfortable. It was like mine had been fitted specifically for my body. I noticed that Tryt\u2019s chair was also the perfect size for him. And so was Soy\u2019s. Deli\u2019s chair was the only one that wasn\u2019t the exact right size. It was even taller than mine, and she had to hop up to sit on it. \n\n\u201cThese are beautiful chairs, Mr. Tryt, sir. Are they made out of glass, Mr. Tryt?\u201d said Soy. \n\n\u201cYour words are more transparent than the chairs, Soy,\u201d answered Tryt. \n\nSoy shot me a puzzled look. \n\n\u201cTransparent,\u201d I whispered, \u201cit means he can see right through it and knows what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n \t\u201cAh,\u201d Soy whispered back. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t like him.\u201d\n \t\u201cSoy, I think he can hear everything we\u2019re saying,\u201d I responded shyly.\n\n\u201cOh, because of those pointy elf ears? You might be right. He can probably hear Miss Weaver\u2019s lesson from here with those things.\u201d \n\nBy this point, Tryt was glaring at Soy.\n \t\u201cMiss Weaver isn\u2019t teaching right now. She\u2019s on a break,\" Tryt said. \n\nI looked at Tryt and wondered if he was being serious. His face hadn\u2019t changed and, besides that, Tryt didn\u2019t seem like the type of fairy who was known for joking around. Although, to be fair, I could count the number of fairies that I knew on one finger. \n\n\u201cHow do you know what Miss Weaver is doing right now?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s the pointy ears,\u201d whispered Soy.\n \t\u201cA fairytale begins when a single sentence appears in the Book of Lore. After that, it is up to the fairies to record what happens. In order to do so, we must keep a close eye on all those who may be involved in the story. For this we use lore,\u201d Tryt said. When he spoke, it wasn\u2019t with the same kindness as Deli, but it still made me feel better to know that he and his fairies had been looking out for us. \u201cAnd our ears aren\u2019t that pointy,\u201d he added crisply. \n\nSoy smiled back, rubbed the top of his ear and then pretended to cut his finger on a pointy edge. Apparently, Soy was no longer worried about staying on Tryt\u2019s good side. Given his history, it wasn\u2019t all that surprising. Soy never got along with authority figures; it usually took less than a day for him to get into a battle with one. The fastest that I ever saw it happen was when he held a \u201cspecial election\u201d on the walk to school and decided that he would only respond to \u201cPresident Soy\u201d from then on. (I was the only other person who voted, and Soy told me there was an error with my ballot). We never made it past roll call that day. \n\n\u201cSo are the fairies speaking to you right now?\u201d I asked, still not understanding. \n\nTryt pulled out a shiny yellowish pen from the pocket of his robe. It had a broad tip, and the top of it was an even shinier crown of gold. There was something about the shape that grabbed my attention, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. \n\n\u201cMagic pens are extremely powerful. They can use lore in many ways. I use the Fairytale Pen to collect information from fairies all over the world. It\u2019s how I\u2019m able to write the stories as they happen,\u201d he explained.\n \t\u201cThis isn\u2019t a story. It\u2019s our lives,\u201d Soy protested.\n \t\u201cI see no difference,\u201d replied Tryt coldly. \n\n\u201cHow do the fairies collect the information? Are they watching Miss Weaver right now?\u201d I wondered out loud.\n \t\u201cAs you know by now, magic can be used to disguise. The fairies take the form of small creatures that go largely unnoticed by humans,\u201d Tryt explained. \n\nDeli hadn\u2019t spoken in a little while, and instead sat listening. I looked at her for a moment and thought about what Tryt had just said. \u201cSmall creatures\u2026 so, does that mean that Deli\u2026\u201d\n \t\u201cNo,\u201d replied Tryt, \u201ca fairy would never choose the shape of a frog. And Deli isn\u2019t a fairy, she\u2019s\u2014\u201c\n\nDeli cut him off before he could finish. \u201cWhat about Ream? What\u2019s he up to now?\u201d she asked loudly. \n\n\u201cAh, yes. The King of Dragons,\u201d he responded. \n\nDeli nodded, happy to have changed the subject. \n\n\u201cHe took his human form again and stole a costume from the set of the school play,\u201d said Tryt. \u201cHe left the grounds twenty minutes after you fled.\u201d He was staring at Soy when he said the final word.\n \t\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d I asked. \n\nTryt paused for a moment and looked at Deli. Deli looked back at Tryt. She waited for an answer. It was clear that Deli had been just as much in the dark as we were since leaving the school. \n\n\u201cHe went to your house,\u201d Tryt said to me. \u201cMy fairies tell me you missed each other by less than two minutes.\" \n\nIt took a moment for the news to sink in. I looked through the fancy table at the grass. A dragon. At my house. With my mom. The thought scared me beyond words. And then I got angry. I stood up from the the table and pressed my hands down hard. \n\n\u201cMy mom was home when we left!\u201d I shouted.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d said Tryt, \u201cnow calm down and have a seat.\u201d\n \t\u201cNo! He\u2019s a dragon, and he could destroy my entire house with one breath and my mom is inside!\u201d \n\nI was hysterical. The tears came pouring down. My view of the courtyard blended into watery colors. Deli hopped onto the table and then onto my shoulder. She patted the back of my head. It was so soft that I could barely feel it, but still, it was nice. She spoke to me in a soothing voice.\n\n\u201cShe's all right,\u201d Deli said.\n \tTryt spoke in a matter-of-fact way. \"Ream cannot enter your home. He was struck with stonegold in a battle many years ago, and it cannot be removed. Stonegold is an ancient metal with a strong magic. It\u2019s the same magic that forged The Fairytale Pen,\u201d Tryt explained, gesturing towards the pen he had shown me. Through my teary eyes, the shape looked even more familiar to me. \n \t\u201cThat\u2019s the same color as his bowtie,\u201d I noticed.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d said Deli, \u201cReam\u2019s stonegold was in the form of a bowtie when you met him. But lore is able to control stonegold, and nothing that touches it may enter your home unless the fairies permit it. It\u2019s the same magic that has protected Pavidale for centuries.\u201d Her voice faltered a bit as she spoke the last words. \n\nSoy stood up now, looking just as upset as I had moments ago. \n\n\u201cWhat about my mom? What about my family?!\u201d he asked.\n \t\u201cWe\u2019ve done the same for your home,\u201d replied Tryt, \u201calthough your brothers proved to be a challenge.\u201d\n \tSoy laughed a little in relief. \u201cHa, yeah that sounds right.\u201d\n \t\u201cMy fairies found them throwing a squirrel out of a window when they arrived,\u201d Tryt said with disgust. \n\n\u201cThey must\u2019ve found another one,\u201d said Soy, a bit more relaxed.\n \t\u201cYes, well it won\u2019t be a problem anymore. Two of my most trusted fairies gave the squirrel enough lore to truly fly. When your brothers tried to throw it out the window this morning, the squirrel simply kept on going and flew away.\u201d\n \tSoy smiled now. \u201cHow did they take it?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cRick accused Hank of throwing the squirrel too hard. Hank accused Rick of secretly attaching it to a drone. They wrestled for seven minutes, and then looked up \u201cflying squirrels\u201d online for the next two hours on their phones,\u201d Tryt elaborated.\n\nIt occurred to me then that fairies must be better with details than any other creature in the world, imaginary or real (although, I felt like I didn\u2019t know which animals belonged to which category anymore).\n\n\u201cGood for the squirrel,\u201d said Soy.\n\n\u201cSo what happens if our families leave our homes?\u201d I asked, becoming nervous again. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Tryt, \u201cReam left Stagwood hours ago and is headed towards us.\n\n11. FOR FAIRY EYES ONLY. \n\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us that right away?\u201d Soy asked as he stood up.\n \t\u201cYou did not ask,\u201d replied Tryt, still seated.\n \t\u201cI also didn\u2019t ask to be flown here to hang out inside a cloud with a pointy-eared jerk. But here I am!\u201d Soy shouted. \n\nTyrt stood up too, but as a fairy, it didn\u2019t have the same dramatic effect.\n\n\u201cSoy, let\u2019s just calm down,\u201d I said to him. \"They\u2019re trying to help us.\u201d\n \t\u201cThey\u2019re the whole reason we\u2019re in this mess,\u201d Soy said gruffly. \u201cHow do we even know we belong here?\u201d \n\nSoy had made a pretty good point. It seemed that Ream was only interested in us because Deli was, and she still hadn\u2019t shown us any evidence that either Soy or I was the hero. For a moment, I imagined that maybe everything was a mistake, and that we might be able to end this all and go home. The thought didn\u2019t make me sad, but it didn\u2019t make me happy either. \n\n\u201cI believe we can answer that,\u201d said Deli from my shoulder.\n \tAs she hopped onto the table in front of Tryt, she spoke only to him. \u201cIt\u2019s time to show them,\u201d she asserted. \n\nTryt\u2019s face told me that he wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea. He wore the same expression that I had when my mom insisted that I do my homework right when I got home. I knew that she was right, and that it wasn\u2019t her fault she was right, but I still didn\u2019t like it. \n\nTryt raised one of his pink fluorescent wings and motioned some fairies over, using it like an arm. Four fairies came flying in from the side of the courtyard, opposite from where we entered. They were carrying a large dark brown book. \n\nThese fairies had on a kind of medieval armor made from the same glass as the chairs and table. The book they were carrying was thicker than a dictionary and wider. It was the kind of book that Soy would have openly protested if we had been assigned to read it for our class. He once protested that making kids read anything over one hundred pages was technically illegal, but he never found the proof to support it. \n\nDespite the size, it still seemed that the book was heavier than it looked, since the fairies were out of breath by the time they put it down on the table. Tryt shooed them away with his wing, and they disappeared straight up and out of the courtyard. \n\nWhen the fairies left, Soy and I stood up at the same time to inspect the book. It was a dusty, rundown book. But something about it was beautiful. There were no words on the cover, and it was hard to say whether they had rubbed off or they were just never there at all. A buckle with a lock ran horizontally across, made of the strange yellowish-gold that I now knew. \n\n\u201cStonegold?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d said Tryt, \u201conly a magic pen may write in the Book of Lore, but it does not hurt to be safe.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy would anybody want to mess with the book?\u201d asked Soy.\n\n\u201cThe Book of Lore chronicles every fairytale throughout history. Changing them would change the fate of the world,\u201d answered Tryt indignantly. Soy didn\u2019t bother responding this time. \n\nAll four of us gathered closer, hovering over the book as Tryt held up his shiny pen. Without a word, he turned it over, placed the crown top inside the stonegold lock and turned it. The buckle surrendered, opening up with a low hiss. I thought the pages smelled like pine trees, but didn\u2019t say it out loud. Tryt began flipping through the book and it was hard to see the words. Whenever I did catch a glimpse, the writing was hard to focus on at first, but then got more clear. The words were written in fancy, old looking letters.\n\nSoy was poking his head even closer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in English,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought it might be in fairy or elvish, or something weird like that.\u201d \n\nTryt glanced at Deli, then back to the page. It was obvious from his voice that he was agitated. \u201cIt\u2019s not in English. The fairytales in the Book of Lore appear in the first language of whomever is reading it,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s English,\u201d said Soy, pointing at the book.\n \t\u201cSoy, to you it is in English, but to someone else it may be in French or German,\u201d said Deli. \n\n\u201cIf it was in French of German, I wouldn\u2019t be able to read it,\u201d Soy explained simply, \u201cso that\u2019s how I know it\u2019s in English.\u201d \n\nTryt let out an un-fairylike grunt and continued flipping through the pages while he spoke. \u201cThe characters in these stories had their fates sealed by the outcomes written here. But there is one fairytale that remains unique. Ream\u2019s first fairytale.\u201d\n \t\u201cHe was part of a different fairytale?\u201d I asked with surprise. That seemed like a big deal to me. \n\n\u201cYes,\" Tryt replied. \"When a hero or heroine defeats a villain, their story and their fate are sealed within this book. All the rile of those who were defeated, all of their magic, is confined within the book so that they may never use it against the world again. And every villain inside the Book of Lore was defeated, save one.\" \n\n\u201cReam,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Deli. \u201cInstead of defeat, his tale ended with an escape. That is why he was able to hold onto his rile.\u201d\n \t\u201cHe was injured. Pierced with stonegold to be exact,\u201d Tryt said as he slowed his page-turning. \u201cAnd once stonegold pierces you, it may never be removed or covered. That is why Ream always has a piece of stonegold visible, regardless of his disguise.\" \n\n\u201cBut nobody has explained yet why he\u2019s after us,\u201d said Soy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything to him!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a patient child, are you, Soy?\u201d asked Tryt in a half-question.\n \t\u201cAnd you don\u2019t own a bookmark,\u201d rebutted Soy, not-at-all in the form of a question. \n\nTryt turned one last page, then covered it with his fairy hand, unleashing a slew of pink sparkles that shot out to conceal the center. He spoke only to me.\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 is your fairytale. And this is the reason that Ream is after you. It may be the last fairytale that is ever written. All the fairytales that came before it, and all the creatures inside of them are at stake. It offers Ream and the forces of rile a chance to change their fate.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut, why are you calling it mine?\u201d I asked shyly. \n\nDeli looked up at me. \n\n\u201cBecause you are the hero,\u201d she replied. \n\nTryt moved his hand, and the sparkles flew away. Written on the page in a thousand languages, but in English to me, was the title: The Boy and The Flying Bed. And underneath it, there was a small drawing. \n\nIt was the same one I had been drawing when I noticed a frog staring at me from behind a window. \n\n12. PLANS. \nThe drawing in the book was the same shape that I had dreamt about, and I finally realized what it was. \n\n\u201cIs that supposed to mean something to me?\u201d asked Soy.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s... something that I was drawing that day in class when I saw Deli,\u201d I told him. \n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve seen this book before?\u201d he asked.\n \t\u201cNo, never,\u201d I answered.\n \t\u201cYou are the first humans to see it,\u201d said Tryt solemnly. \"It is a great honor that I have bestowed upon you.\u201d\n \t\u201cWell, we deserve to be bestowed,\u201d said Soy (clearly not sure what the word meant). \u201cSo, what do the rest of the pages say?\u201d he asked. \n\nTryt closed the book with surprising strength. \n\n\u201cAll you need to know is that if you fail, the consequences will be dire,\u201d said Tryt. \n\n\u201cOkay, but I feel like we\u2019re missing something major here,\u201d Soy stated.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Deli. \n\n\u201cSo, Ream\u2019s the villain and he\u2019s the hero?\u201d Soy asked as he pointed to me.\n \t\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Tryt.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d said Deli.\n \t\u201cAnd I\u2019m some kind of expert guide who helps the hero because I am the only one who can,\u201d Soy continued. \n\n\u201cNobody said that,\u201d said Tryt.\n \t\u201cBut what is the point of the fairytale? What\u2019s the thing we have to beat Ream at?\u201d Soy inquired. \n\nSoy asked the one question that I'd forgotten to ask. There was always a reason for the fairytale. Sometimes a giant was terrorizing a village, and sometimes a kingdom was under siege by a witch, but it was always something. What was it that Ream wanted? Why was there a fairytale at all? \n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious too,\u201d I said, \u201cand that title doesn\u2019t seem to help.\u201d \n\nDeli jumped on top of the book in a puff of shiny dust. Her head was low as she spoke. \t\t\t\u201cReam didn\u2019t escape his fairytale by chance. He knew things that helped him. Things that he shouldn\u2019t have known.\u201d \n\n\u201cSomebody helped him, then?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cWe believe so,\u201d said Deli.\n \t\u201cSome believe so,\u201d said Tryt, glaring at Deli.\n \t\u201cWhat we know for sure,\u201d she replied, \u201cis that once he escaped, he set out to find the one thing that could make him more powerful.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat is it?!\u201d asked Soy, \u201cSome kind of magic wand?\u201d\n \t\u201cNo,\u201d said Tryt. Then he turned to Deli and me. \u201cWhy do you let him guess so much. He\u2019s terrible at it.\u201d\n \t\u201cHey!\u201d Soy yelled. \u201cI can still hear you. Regular-sized ears work, too.\u201d\n \t\u201cHow would you like it if I turned you into a newt?\u201d said Tryt, staring angrily at Soy.\n \t\u201cTryt!\u201d exclaimed Deli.\n \tTryt immediately got back his composure and confessed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2026 he just, draws my ire.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, well you should really work on that,\u201d said Soy.\n\nI spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s the pen isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nSoy look at me, puzzled.\n\n\u201cThat shape in the book and the shape that I was drawing in class; it\u2019s a symbol for your Fairytale Pen isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked Tryt.\n\n\u201cA pen,\u201d Tryt answered, \u201cbut not mine.\u201d \n\nHe lifted the pen up to show us more details. As he spun it, I saw the stonegold shimmer and spin like it was alive. It was mesmerizing. \n\nSoy had done battle with a hypnotist once at a birthday party. She made the mistake of picking Soy to be the volunteer, and it all went downhill from there. By the time Soy was selected, he was already convinced that he could hypnotize the hypnotist. We watched them try to hypnotize each other for about a half-hour. Her with techniques that she had learned over the years, and him with exaggerated movements and words like \u201cabracadabra\u201d. When she finally asked him to sit down, Soy commanded her to sit down, instead. That lasted another five minutes.\n\nBut even Soy was entranced with the spinning pen.\n\nTryt explained as it spun, \u201cBefore time was time, there was a King of the Mountain. He ruled the world along with his brother, the King of the Valley, and his sister, the Queen of the Sea. But the King of the Mountain wanted to rule alone. An advisor, a fairy himself, told the King of the Mountain about two hidden wells of legend. One held all of the good magic in the world: the ancient Well of Lore. The other held all of the evil magic, known as the Well of Rile. The fairy told the King of the Mountain that if he could control these wells, he would become more powerful than his brother and sister combined. That very day, the King of the Mountain enslaved his entire kingdom, magical and non-magical creatures alike, charging them all with finding the wells. It was a group of eight dwarves, being the most skilled at digging, who found the wells deep within a mountain.\u201d \n\n\u201cEight dwarves?\u201d I repeated.\n \t\u201cYes, eight. Why?\u201d Tryt inquired.\n \t\u201cJust used to hearing seven. Please, keep going,\u201d I said.\n \tHe continued, \u201cHowever, the dwarves did not go back and tell their king as he had commanded. Because of his cruelty, the dwarves used the magic of the wells to craft two pens and a book instead. The first pen was made with the most powerful magic from the wells. It had the ability to create tales from nothing, and make them real. This pen is known as the Author Pen. It is the pen you were drawing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, if you write something, it comes true?\u201d I asked. Deli nodded, then gestured for me to keep listening. \n\n\u201cNext they crafted the pen you see before you, using a strong, but less powerful magic. Then the dwarves dipped a blank mining ledger into the wells, creating The Book of Lore. As I have said, only these two magical pens are powerful enough to write on its pages. And when a story is completed within the Book of Lore, it becomes known to all the kingdoms in every corner of the globe, so that the world may learn from them.\u201d \n\nI stared at the book with a new sense of wonder.\n\nTryt explained, \u201cThe dwarves used the power of the Author Pen to make sure that the King of the Mountain would never find the wells for himself. Unable to find them and use their magic, the king was not strong enough to defeat his brother and sister. He was banished, and the \u201cMountain and Valley\u201d became known simply as the \u201cLand\u201d. All of the great leaders for centuries to come were descended from one of the two remaining, wise siblings.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat happened to the pens after that?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cA fairy stumbled upon the dwarves at the wells. He had been hiding from the greedy king, deep inside the mountain, refusing to be enslaved,\u201d Tryt said. \"The dwarves decided to give the second pen to the fairy, to keep it safe, and to pay for his silence. But they charged him with much more than just protecting its magic. The fairy would have to be the one to record the tales and would use his brethren to watch these stories unfold. All would know the tales of good and evil, and the pen would seal the fate of villains defeated. They dubbed this pen the Fairytale Pen, and that is what it is used for to this day. This is how fairies became storytellers,\" said Tryt with pride in his voice. \n\n\u201cThis all sounds a bit...made-up-ish,\u201d said Soy.\n \t\u201cI assure you, every word of it is true,\u201d Tryt stated firmly. \n\nSuddenly, I understood why Tryt was taking all of this so seriously. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the fairy in the mountain, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cI am,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cThe one who was hiding?\u201d Soy asked me, the same way that he asked me about characters in movies (during the movies).\n \t\u201cSeems like it,\u201d I whispered.\n \tSoy looked triumphant when he whispered back, \u201cHmph...hiding.\u201d\n \t\u201cAnd the Author Pen, did they give that to you as well?\u201d I asked.\n \tTryt shook his head. \u201cI tried to convince the dwarves to let me care for it as well, but they kept it buried in the mountain. They had decided that no creature should hold both, and used the pen to made it so. I am blocked from finding the wells again, and their story is concealed by magic in the Book of Lore. Instead, they left us with this poem engraved on the inside cover.\" \n\nTryt flipped to the front of the book and pointed to the grey inside cover. As the words settled into English, we read: \n\nOne pen we place in fairy\u2019s hands, lest history be lost. \n\nOne pen we keep inside these buried wells at any cost. \n\nIf ever there is dire need to find the Author Pen,\n \tA hero true of mind and heart will hold it once again. \n\nFind the hero\u2019s mark, and you will make the quest begin.\n \tHe alone can reach the wells and find the pen within.\n \tTwo guides to aid: an expert on the foe they soon will face, \n\nA second known for loyalty, nobility, and grace. \n\nBut such a heavy burden, beg the hero to beware.\n \tTo write more of their fate in ink, we dwarven do not dare. \n\nI read the poem three times, trying my hardest to remember every word. \n\n\u201cNobility and grace! It\u2019s like they knew me,\u201d said Soy.\n \t\u201cYes, speaking of that...\u201d said Tryt to Deli.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d she said immediately. \u201cHe\u2019s the companion. I\u2019ve seen the loyalty part. The rest will come in time.\u201d\n \tTryt resigned himself and got back to us. \u201cSo you see, the Author Pen was locked in the mountain and nobody but the hero can get to it. That\u2019s why we need you.\u201d\n \t\u201cThen there\u2019s one thing that I still don\u2019t understand,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cWhere\u2019s the dire need?\u201d\n \t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Deli.\n \t\u201cIf this hero is me, then I\u2019m the only one who can find this pen, right? So why did the fairytale need to begin. Ream can\u2019t get it without me. So, where\u2019s the urgency? Why not leave it there.\u201d \n\nDeli\u2019s face turned pale. Well, pale green. \n\n\u201cReam is taking fairies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s what??\u201d asked Soy.\n \tTryt replied with a purposeful voice. \u201cFor years now Ream has been taking fairies from us. Some he converts into spies, and others\u2026 well, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to the others.\u201d\n \t\u201cYou see, that\u2019s why we need your help!\u201d said Deli with emotion in her voice. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get that pen and stop Ream, soon there will be no fairies left at all.\u201d \n\nThe fairies\u2019 interest at our arrival made even more sense. I wasn\u2019t just a random person to them, I was suppose to be their hero. At that moment, I knew that\u2019s who I needed to be, whether I liked it or not. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not waste any more time, then. If I\u2019m the only one who can stop Ream, then I\u2019d better get to it,\u201d I declared.\n\nSuddenly the pen glowed brighter, and Tryt started flipping through the pages of the book again, settling back on the most last story. My story. He scribbled down some words, but covered the rest of the page.\n\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d Deli said looking over the page with an enormous smile, \"it looks like the hero has finally taken his place in the story.\"\n \t\u201cThere it is!\u201d shouted Soy, \u201cThere\u2019s your name!\u201d \n\nThe line read: \u201cWithin Pavidale, the meeting of the four had concluded. So began Cal\u2019s quest for the pen.\u201d \n\n13. ROAD TRIP. \nIt was time to go. Still, I wanted to know as much as I could from The Book of Lore.  \n\n\u201cCan we see Ream\u2019s fairytale?\u201d I asked politely.\nTryt shut the book swiftly, again. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d he answered. \"That story is not yet completed, and I\u2019ve already shown you too much. It\u2019s time to go.\u201d \n\nDeli agreed. \n\nTryt escorted us out the back of the garden. As we passed under another ornate archway, we stepped onto a path made of stone. It lead us to a wooden platform near the edge of the cloud. From inside, the cloud had a slightly blue color to it, like a lighter shade of sky. \n\nEvery once in awhile, a fairy would fly in through the cloud wall onto the platform, and the spot where they entered shimmered with orange for a moment. I figured that this must be the right way to enter Pavidale. I felt even more embarrassed that I had entered by dropping my bed into a pond. But, in fairness to me, it\u2019s not like there was a sign\u2026\n\n \n\nOn the very edge of the platform, my bed was waiting, fully restored to its normal, dry self. Even our backpacks were there, looking as full as ever. A few fairies were still working on the bed, using instruments and contraptions I had never seen before. I wished that I could inspect them closer up. \n\n\u201cWait a second, we\u2019re going back on the bed?\u201d Soy asked.\n\u201cThe bed knows where the mountain is,\u201d Deli said.\n\u201cWell, there are planes and cars and boats too. And they know where things are, when you tell them. It\u2019s called GPS,\u201d he responded.\n\u201cAnd do you know what GPS stands for?\u201d she asked. \n\nSoy looked at me. \n\n\u201cGlobal positioning system,\u201d I whispered softly.\n\u201cGlobule position sanctity,\u201d Soy boasted.\nDeli smiled. \u201cClose enough. And to use it, you need an exact location. Nobody knows where the mountain is without magic. That\u2019s why only a vessel using lore can find it.\u201d \n\nDeli hopped on the front of the bed, and I followed behind. Soy climbed up slowly in protest. \n\n\u201cAsk anyone who\u2019s not a magical frog: planes are better than beds,\u201d he mumbled. \n\n\u201cI told you I\u2019m not a frog,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t told us what you are, and frog is still the most obvious choice,\u201d Soy argued. \n\nIt was the same logic Soy had used with me many times. When I had a secret that he wanted to know, he would make a guess that was ridiculously wrong and then assume it was right until I told him otherwise. It worked on me. Every. Single. Time. \n\nI felt like Deli was telling the truth, that she wasn\u2019t a frog, but that didn\u2019t mean I was any closer to knowing what she was.\n\n \n\nTryt flew to the front of the bed with impressive speed.\n\nHe addressed only Deli, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to go with you two, you know.\u201d\n\u201cHe does,\u201d she answered, \u201cand you know that. Besides, I have a feeling he\u2019s more valuable than you think.\u201d \n\nTryt did a graceful flip to the back of the bed. We all prepared to depart. \n\n\u201cWe will return when Ream is defeated, and the pen is safe again,\u201d announced Deli. \n\nI turned around and realized that the all the fairies were on the platform watching us, and there were even more of them than when we first arrived. I saw young fairies flying around clumsily and older fairies using their wings to hold themselves upright. I had the sad thought that there used be far more fairies in Pavidale, before the yellow dragon started taking them\u2026 before my fairytale began. \n\n \n\nDeli started punching commands into the phone, but Tryt stopped her. \n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cI will create a current for you to ride on. It will work with the bed to take you straight there and, as long as you don\u2019t stray, you will go much faster.\" \n\nDeli looked at him with gratitude and bowed her head.\n\u201cIt is important for Cal to get there without delay. If I can do anything to help, I will,\u201d he added. \n\nTryt began to glow much brighter. His face became hard to see. In fact, he started to look like he was just a pink ball of light. \n\n \n\nI looked ahead at the wall of the cloud. It was fascinating. A hole with an orange outline started to form in front of us, shooting off sparks like a lightning storm. The fairies got behind us and pushed the bed forward. As the front of the bed peeked out of the cloud, I saw that there was nothing below us. In a few seconds, the bed tipped down and we started to plummet. The air was cold enough to sting my face. \n\nBefore I could get scared and without warning, an invisible river of air caught us from below and quickly carried us away. I turned to see the cloud one last time. The fairies were filling the hole with their faces to watch us as it closed. Tryt was in front. The glow on his face began to fade as the hole finally shut. Pavidale was a special place, and I hoped that one day I would visit the home of the fairies again. The wind was cutting through us, as I remembered that unless I defeated Ream, there may be no fairies left to visit. \n\n14. OVER THE SEVENTH SEA. \nThe current we were riding started turning red as we got further away from Pavidale. It stretched out ahead of us for what must have been miles, with no end in sight. Tryt had been right about one thing for sure; we were going twice as fast as we had on our way to Pavidale. \n\nDeli tinkered with the phone and put the shield up so that we could relax. Still, it was twenty minutes before Soy and I felt comfortable enough to sit back.\n\n\u201cSo, what happens when we get to the mountain?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t know much,\u201d said Deli. \n\nAfter a few minutes, she spoke again. \n\n\u201cThere are supposed to be three tests that you must pass before you can find the wells.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cI meant it when I said that I don\u2019t know much,\u201d she answered. \n\nThe bed had completely settled into the current by then, and the ride was smooth. I saw land pass by to the north or south\u2026 or east or west (I had gotten turned around in the cloud), but mostly we flew over sea. Occasionally we would see tiny islands below us. Soy asked if we could fly down and stop at the first three, but Deli refused each time. \n\n\u201cTryt\u2019s current won\u2019t last forever. He told us to stay on course and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d she told Soy. \n\n\u201cBut there might be hidden treasure down there. Pirates love hiding treasure on islands like that!\u201d Soy rebutted. \n\nI decided not to weigh in, until the third time. \n\n\u201cSoy, if we find the wells, defeat Ream, save the fairies, and make it out alive, I promise we can come back and explore an island.\u201d \n\nSoy stopped asking. Any objection to that would mean that he doubted our return, and nobody wanted to do that.\n\nThe few clouds that speckled the sky formed and disappeared quickly, like puffs of smoke. Later on, the current took us straight inside a thin white cloud that gave me a nice feeling as we flew through. There was nothing inside though, not like Pavidale. I was beginning to like clouds more and more, until I spotted a dark one.\n\nAt first it was just a black spot in the distance. We sat in awe as it grew larger and larger ahead of us. Closer up, I could tell that it was actually dark grey. There was flashing all over it, like a lightning storm was raging inside. Eventually, it was almost all that we could see. I got a queasy feeling in my stomach when I recognized the shape it had taken: a ferocious ocean wave. It was a cloud filled with rile.\n\n\u201cUm, Deli,\u201d I asked. \u201cCan we get off the current now?\u201d \n\nDeli jumped to the controls and began pushing buttons. I didn\u2019t notice anything change. She started pushing them more frantically. Nothing happened. I tried grabbing the wheel but it was glued to the bed and wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on Deli?!\u201d Soy screamed as the wall of darkness loomed. It must\u2019ve been the largest storm cloud I had ever seen. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Deli yelled back. \u201cThe cloud is pulling us in!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat can we do?!\u201d I cried.\n \n\nBut I never heard an answer. The dark cloud swallowed us whole. \n\n15. STORMSIDE. \nThe cloud was hollow, just like Pavidale. I doubted this place had a nice name of its own, or any name at all. It was empty and sad. There were some deep holes among the layer of rocks that covered the ground. I imagined this cloud might be home to some nasty creatures, but nothing was there to greet us. \n\nThe bed, it turned out, couldn\u2019t fly inside the cloud and started to dip the moment we entered. We hit the ground hard and skidded to a soft stop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the rile,\u201d said Deli. \"It\u2019s too strong for the bed to work in here.\u201d \n\nI was surprised to find that I could see fairly well. The whole place was lit by a dim red light coming from another small pond, just like in Pavidale. But this pond looked mean and gloomy.\n\nWe all sensed it was probably best to whisper.\n\n\u201cHow do we get out of here? Can we push the bed back out?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cIt will just suck us right back in,\u201d Deli said. \"We\u2019ll need to carry the bed across to the other side.\u201d\n \t\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d Soy said in an angry whisper. \u201cThis looks like the same place from my nightmares! And they never end well!\u201d\n \t\u201cWhat do you suggest we do then?\u201d she asked coolly.\n \t\u201cCall up the fairies and get them to pick us up with a new bed. A king-sized one this time. \tI\u2019ll wait here,\u201d Soy said as he sat cross-legged and cross-armed.\n \t\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, Soy. There\u2019s no way to reach them from in here,\u201d she replied. \n\n\u201cWell, too bad, because I\u2019m not moving. I\u2019m pretty positive that those holes are filled with monsters,\" Soy responded. \"And you\u2019re going to get gobbled up. Gobbled. Right. Up.\u201d\n \t\u201cWill you talk to him, please?\u201d Deli said, turning to me. \n\nSoy was pretending to chew while he stared at Deli. \u201cOM NOM NOM NOM,\u201d was all he would say. \n\nI sat down next to him. \n\n\u201cSoy, I know this isn\u2019t what you signed up for when you became my best friend.\u201d \n\nHe nodded dramatically.\n \t\u201cBut, I need you. And those fairies need you even more than I do,\u201d I pleaded.\n \tSoy wasn\u2019t moved. \n\n\u201cIf you walk across this cloud, you\u2019re going to get eaten by the green hog monster things in those holes. And I\u2019m not going to watch it happen.\u201d \n\nI understood now that he wasn\u2019t just angry, he was worried. Worried for me. But my mind was racing from what he had said. \n\n\u201cSoy, how do you know what\u2019s in those holes?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cI told you, this place is just like the one from the nightmare I\u2019ve had dozens of times. And I always get eaten!\u201d he whimpered. \n\nI looked at Deli. She\u2019d heard it too. \n\n\u201cSoy\u2026 you\u2019re here to save us,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.\n \t\u201cThere\u2019s a reason you had those dreams, Soy, just like there\u2019s a reason why my bed can fly. You were always meant to be my guide. You got gobbled up in those nightmares, so that we wouldn\u2019t get gobbled up in real life. You are the only one who can get us through this cloud.\u201d\n \tHe opened his mouth, but before he could speak, I repeated, \u201cThe only one.\u201d \n\nHe sat there for a moment, staring at the ground. Then he looked back towards the cloud wall that we just passed through. Finally he let out a big sigh, and rose to his feet. \n\n\u201cRight,\" he said, \u201cCal, grab the other side of the mattress, then both of you get behind me. We need to move quickly. I think I may have figured the way out last time.\u201d\n \t\u201cGot it, Soy. I trust you,\u201d I told him.\n \t\u201cSo do I,\u201d said Deli. \n\nShe jumped on the bed as we lifted it up. It wasn\u2019t heavy, but it wasn\u2019t light. From where we stood, the far end of the cloud looked at least two football fields away, but it was hard to tell. I started to notice that the holes weren\u2019t the only obstacles in our way. There were bumps in the ground that looked like small hills, and some tall, scraggily looking trees. \n\nIt took Soy and me a minute to get our steps in sync, but once we did we moved well together. Soy weaved the bed in-between the holes deftly, and periodically stopped to change course. He had made it clear that under no circumstances should we make noise. Apparently, in his dreams, making too much noise tended to get him eaten. A lot. \n\nAt that moment, in the dark cloud filled with rile, with monsters sleeping below our feet, Soy was leading us. And he was doing it well. We made it about halfway through without any trouble, but then it looked like Soy was stuck. There were three large holes in front of us and a few trees to our right. I spoke softly. \n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cI\u2019ve seen these holes before,\u201d he whispered back, \u201cand I\u2019ve never gotten past them. There are hog monsters in each one. The middle one has the biggest.\u201d \n\nHe turned to face me. \u201cBigger than a truck.\u201d\n\nDeli and I sat patiently while Soy planned our next move. He motioned for me to turn the bed on its side and led us to the skinny trees. As we squeezed between them, Soy and I were careful not to touch a single branch. I looked closely at the lowest one and realized the true danger. What I thought was a leaf wasn\u2019t a leaf at all. It was a sleeping animal. It had long claws that wrapped around the branch three times, and its wings came together to form a flat surface that made it resemble a humongous leaf. It wasn\u2019t just this one creature that worried me really; it was the 500 more that were sleeping above it.\n\nOnce we passed through the trees, we came to a low, rocky hill. It was steep enough to make me tired, and Soy was getting winded, too. When we got to the top, we had no choice but to rest for a minute. At the far foot of the hill was another hole and two more trees, larger than the batch we had just passed. It would be difficult, but we could make our way through if we were careful and took our time. \n\nSoy laid down on the bed while Deli took a moment to take stock of how much ground we had covered. I was the only one looking forward, so I was the first one to see the light. It wasn\u2019t like any other light inside the cloud. It was a dull yellow glow coming from inside the hole at the bottom of the hill. But I knew that it wasn\u2019t actually yellow\u2026 it was stonegold. \n\n\u201cSoy\u2026 Deli,\u201d I said with a tremble, \u201cLook!\u201d \n\nThey turned in time to see Ream fly up from inside the hole, spreading his wings. He had found us. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen his full body in the school. The auditorium wasn\u2019t large enough for him to show his full form. Ream\u2019s wings were larger than I could have possibly imagined. He was the King of Dragons, and I was frozen in fear. My heart beat out of my chest. My legs locked in place. I felt smaller than I ever had before. Ream flapped his wings and sent a tornado of wind towards us. \n\n\u201cSo, this is the hero that you send to his doom?\u201d bellowed Ream. \u201cThe boy named Cal?\u201d He bared his teeth and looked at me with a glint of gold in his eyes. \n\n\u201cYou will not touch him!\u201d shouted Deli, \u201cYou will not speak his name!\u201d\n\nShe jumped in front of me, trying to shield me. She was no larger than one of his claws. As a frog she could not protect me from a dragon. This was not a battle that she could win. But, she did it all the same.  \n\nI felt like I might cry. Then, without a word, Soy stepped up next to Deli, and I did. My best friend, Soy, standing between me and a dragon. Ream started to laugh, like he was happy that they had. \n\n\u201cThis will be easier than I thought\u201d mocked Ream. \u201cYou have failed again, Delilah. Your hero cries.\u201d \n\nBut Ream didn\u2019t understand. There are all kinds of tears. Some tears are for a sad rainy day, and some are too happy for just words. Some don\u2019t even tell you why they\u2019re there. But, then there are tears that have fight inside them. Those were the tears that found me. I promised myself that we would be leaving that cloud. \n\nI picked up a rock and took aim behind us. There was only one hole that I wanted to hit. When I made the baseball team last spring, I practiced throwing a ball against the wall every day after school, and it was about to pay off. I squared my shoulders and feet, and brought my arm back. Hurling the rock with all my strength, I watched it fall out of sight into the hole. We didn\u2019t have to wait long. \n\nThe monster came barreling out within seconds. I could see why Soy had called it a hog. Its snout was long and flat with pulsing nostrils, and I could see long, sharp teeth even with its mouth closed. It came forward on four legs with a row of spikes shooting up from the top of its back. \n\n\u201cYep, they\u2019ll do that,\u201d said Soy.\n\nThe creature was so mad that it spit as it stomped the ground.\n\nReam flapped his wings and flew back slightly, but not in retreat. He was laughing again.\n\n\u201cYou think that a warlug will save you? What do you think was in this rock hole before I got here? They make for delicious meals!\u201d he said. \n\nThe warlug, a name I had just learned, took a moment to look around and then charged up the hill towards us. \n\n\u201cGrab the bed and follow me!\u201d I yelled. \n\nWe started down the hill as fast as we could. Ream was content to watch the chase unfold. It seemed to amuse him. We were almost at the bottom when the warlug reached the top of the hill. He ran straight downhill at a blistering pace. \n\nWhen the ground leveled off, I made Soy help me prop the bed up between two trees. We were careful not to touch any branches. We had barely finished when the warlug closed in on us. Ream knew that we couldn\u2019t outrun it, and he smirked.\n\nI looked at my two companions. \n \t\u201cWhen I say so, jump to the right,\u201d I said. \n\nWe hid behind the bed as the warlug charged towards us with furious speed. It was ten yards away, then five. I could hear its angry breath from behind the mattress. \n\n\u201cNow!\u201d I yelled. \n\nWe jumped out from behind the mattress, beyond the trees that held it up. The warlug saw us and tried to change course at the last second, but it was too late. Its body went sideways, and its momentum carried it forward. Its body crashed into the trees, hard enough to shake them to their roots. And that was exactly what we needed it to do.\n\nIn a single moment, every sleeping eye on the trees had opened, and the winged creatures fluttered up. Over a thousand leafy creatures went parading into the sky. They blocked out everything else from sight, including Ream. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d screamed Deli. \n\nWe grabbed the bed, and Soy took the lead again. Without second guessing, we sprinted past hole after hole. From above us, Ream let out a deafening roar. I looked back for just a moment to see the creatures swarming him from every angle. \n\nWe were almost to the cloud\u2019s edge when the holes ahead began to come alive with noise. Warlugs were stirring inside. By the time some of the hogs started rising, we had just three more holes to pass. The first two were empty, but I saw a particularly spiky warlug poking his head out of the last one. He saw us just as we were about to pass and we only had a second to decide what to do. \n\n\u201cJump!\u201d shouted Soy. \n\nSoy vaulted above the warlug as it eyed me up behind him. I took one step straight onto the top of its head and launched myself forward, flipping onto the bed. It chomped down on the empty air and let out a groan. As I landed, the mattress hit the ground.\n\nThe warlug\u2019s hole had a slope of dirt on the other side that led directly to the cloud\u2019s edge. The mattress skid down bumpily. Soy couldn\u2019t outrun it and got scooped up when it hit his legs. Deli was between us again. Without a sound, we slid out of the dark cloud and onto the current, which had been waiting for us in the quiet night sky. \n\n16. BOY MEETS FROG, AGAIN. \nI spent the next hour staring out the orange shield, down onto the ocean. Nowhere felt safe. Ream had found us in the middle of the sky. He\u2019d known where we would be, and he\u2019d been waiting. But when I finally decided to speak, it was about something else entirely. \n\n\u201cDeli, what did Ream mean when he said that you\u2019d failed, again?\u201d I asked. \n\nDeli, looked exhausted. \u201cI guess it\u2019s as good a time as any to tell you,\u201d she said. \n\nShe hopped in front of us, and began to explain. \n\n\u201cI was a hero once, and Ream was my villain. He was the fiercest that we had ever seen, and the first to have been named King of the Dragons. Back then, Ream had been taking elves and making them fight for him. Tryt said he\u2019d never seen a creature so skilled at building an army. It was my job to defeat him, to make sure that he could never hurt anyone ever again, and it was a great honor to face him. Tryt told me they would be telling our tale until the end of time. Except, it didn\u2019t go the way it was supposed to.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d said Soy. I nudged him from behind. We lost the backpacks in the dark cloud and Soy was getting hangry (hungry and angry).\n\nDeli went on. \u201cThe plan was for me to find him in his lair using a secret entrance. The fairies had found it for me, behind a waterfall. I would catch him by surprise and defeat him with my stonegold bow. Except, that\u2019s not what happened. I found the entrance and swam in through a small rock pool. But, when I crawled out, Ream was waiting for me with his army of elves. I held them off as best I could for as long as I could, but eventually I was cornered. With almost all the magic I had left, I was able to guide one last stonegold arrow at Ream, wounding him. I used the last of my lore to create this disguise and jump into a stream that run through the walls to the base of the waterfall. The blow helped break Ream\u2019s magical hold on the elves, but he had gotten away. Tryt tried to find Ream himself, but he was never able to. I had failed. Ever since then, Ream has been gathering his strength and building his new army. His fairy army.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy you? Why was it your job to save the elves?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cBecause I was their leader. I am their princess,\u201d she said.\n \t\u201cYou\u2026 are an elf princess?\u201d Soy said in disbelief.\n \t\u201cElven princess,\u201d she corrected. \n\n\u201cWhy not change back then?\u201d I asked.\n \t\u201cI can\u2019t. I am bound by the story, just as Ream was bound with the stonegold. Until Ream is defeated, I am stuck in this disguise.\u201d \n\nSoy began to fidget a lot more than usual. \n\n\u201cSo, um, what kind of stuff do you like? If you even like stuff, I mean? What\u2019s like, your favorite of the stuff?\u201d he asked Deli.\n \t\u201cSoy? What are you doing?\" I whispered.\n \t\u201cShe\u2019s an elf princess! I\u2019ve never talked to an elf princess!\u201d \n\n\u201cElven princess,\u201d she corrected. \n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d he said.\n\nDeli jumped on Soy\u2019s shoulder and whispered something into his ear. Soy\u2019s face changed, and he stopped fidgeting. Deli and I made our way to the front of the bed. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I told her, \u201cthis time, we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n \tDeli smiled back at me. \u201cI hope that you\u2019re right.\u201d \n\nShe pointed ahead, and I saw a dark brown mountain rising from the middle of the ocean. It had a bit of snow on top and was surrounded by a forest below.\n\n\u201cThe dwarves set the mountain adrift to make sure that no one could chart a map to it without lore,\u201d Deli explained. \n\nThe current was winding us down towards the mountain. There was an opening between two orange trees at its base. \n\n\u201cWhat did you say to Soy?\u201d I asked her quietly as we descended.\n \tShe whispered, \u201cI told him that I\u2019ve been watching you two for a while. I know that he refuses to go to school every morning without his rocketship underwear. So, he has nothing to be nervous about in front of me.\u201d\n \t\u201cEvery morning?\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cEvery morning. They don\u2019t make them anymore, so his mom can\u2019t buy extra pairs. She has to wash them every night. If they aren\u2019t ready in time, he throws a fit.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \n\nI made a mental note not to forget about the rocketship underwear. \n\n17. THE MOUNTAIN. \nThe entrance to the mountain was the mouth of a large cave. It was easy to walk in, almost like it had been waiting for us. But once we were inside, things got a lot trickier. \n\nThe way was lit with torches that burned violet. They led us down a path that ended abruptly at a stone wall with five wooden doors. Each door was painted a different shade of orange (they were all pretty dull from age). They weren\u2019t tall, as far as doors go. I thought that maybe the dwarves had built them at their own height. And there were words above them, engraved onto a silver plate. \n\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d asked Deli, who was now squinting through her glasses. \n\nI read the plate aloud: \n\nTo find the door, you must be clever, \n\nElse you will be lost forever.\n \tNo amount of magic spells, \n\nWill aid you if you seek the wells. \n\nDon\u2019t forget the trodden trail, \n\nFor those who do are doomed to fail. \n\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d asked Soy. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I answered. \u201cDeli?\u201d \n\nDeli was biting her miniature glasses. For a moment, I thought that I saw a shimmer from inside her mouth. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s some kind of clue. We need to find the right door to get to the wells.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis is easy,\u201d said Soy impatiently, \u201clet\u2019s just try each door, one by one, and look inside.\u201d \n\nHe strode forward to open the door closest to him, second from the left. It was a pale orange door with a carving of an antelope in the center. \n\n\u201cSoy! Stop!\u201d I yelled as I lunged toward him. \n\nThe moment that Soy turned the wooden knob, the door flew in away from him. Soy was being pulled in, too. I reached him in time to grab his other arm and we fell to the ground. I pressed my feet against the wall to pull harder, desperately trying to keep him from being sucked in. \n\n\u201cClose the door!\u201d yelled Deli behind us. \n\nI saw through the opening that this door led to another dark cloud, even scarier than the one we had barely escaped. But something else was different about it, too. Instead of seeing a long field of rock with trees ahead of me, I was looking at a far away wall with holes that faced me. Warlugs jumped out towards us, then fell back away. This door was in the top of the cloud. \n\nThe words, \u201cElse you will be lost forever\" hit me with a chill. Using all my strength, I pulled Soy until he was free from the doorway. The moment he cleared it, the door slammed shut behind him. We rested on the dirt floor, both out of breath. When I looked at the door again, I didn\u2019t see an antelope. Instead, the door had a carving of a lion on it. The color changed slightly as well. Deli hopped over to us, just as frazzled as we were.\n\n\u201cDeli,\u201d I asked, \"did the doors just...\u201d\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d she stopped me short. \u201cThe doors must change each time one is opened.\u201d\n \t\u201cBut wherever the antelope is, we know never to open that one again, right?\u201d Soy asked, still catching his breath.\n\nDeli looked upset, and I understood why. The doors in front of us were now a serpent, a lion, some kind of fish, a spider, and a rhino. No antelope. \n\n\u201cI think the doors are trying to tell us something,\u201d said Deli.\n \t\u201cThat no matter what we do, every door we open will be for the first time,\u201d I finished. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfair!\u201d cried Soy. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that!\u201d \n\nSoy had almost been sucked into a dark cloud, so I could understand why he was upset. I gave him a minute to cool off and turned my attention to the plate. My mom had taught me that when I don\u2019t understand something, I should take it apart piece by piece. Maybe, I thought, that was what I needed to do with the clues. \n\nThe first verse seemed pretty straightforward. To find the right door, we were going to have to be smart. We also knew what might happen if we chose wrong again. The second verse was no mystery either. We couldn\u2019t use lore to find the wells. That meant that Ream wouldn\u2019t be able to use rile to find them, either. Although, he couldn\u2019t get to them without me, anyway. But the last verse was the tricky one. Don\u2019t forget the trodden trail. \n\n\u201cHey Deli,\u201d I asked without taking my eyes off the plate, \u201cwhat exactly does trodden mean?\u201d\n \t\u201cIt means that it\u2019s been walked on before, like a path that\u2019s already been taken,\u201d she answered. \n\nI thought about the story Tryt had told us. The dwarves who found the wells made it almost impossible for anyone else to find them again. So if there was a \u201ctrodden\u201d path, it must have been theirs. But how did they find them in the first place? I had hit another dead end. Tryt never told me which way they went to find the wells. In fact, he had only told me one thing about them, really.\n\nSuddenly it hit me. I read the clue one more time and it all made sense! \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d I shouted.\n \t\u201cWhat is?\u201d asked Deli.\n \t\u201cThe trodden trail is the way that the dwarves got there,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cOkay,\u201d said Soy, perking up. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know how. The clue says that we have to pick the right door, and we still don\u2019t know which one it is. I\u2019m not up for guessing another door, or actually guessing at anything ever again.\u201d\n \t\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t say pick the door. It says, \u2018to find the door, you must be clever.\u2019 The door is hidden!\u201d\n \t\u201cSo\u2026 where is this hidden door?\u201d asked Deli pointing to the empty room.\n \t\u201cThe dwarves found the door because they\u2019re the best diggers. It should be right where they left it, under our feet!\u201d \n\nDeli suggested digging in the center of the room, but I disagreed. There was an area of dirt to the left of the doors that seemed right to me. I couldn\u2019t explain it, so I asked them to trust me. After a few minutes of digging with our hands, Soy and I felt the first sign of the sixth door.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing we found it when we did, because Soy was beginning to get annoyed with Deli. She was directing his digging, and Soy didn\u2019t take kindly to direction from what he described as a \u201cnon-digging frog\u201d. \n\nThe wooden door that we discovered wasn\u2019t orange like the others, but purple. I cleared off the top and bottom, getting it dirtier before it got cleaner. There was another difference about this door compared to the others. The carving in the center wasn\u2019t of an animal; it was a shape that I could now recognize easily. It was a fairy. And something told me that the carving would never change, no matter how many times we opened the door. \n\n\u201cDo the honors, Cal,\u201d said Soy. \n\nI opened the door slowly, not knowing what would pop out at us, or suck us in, but there wasn\u2019t much to see. It was a black tunnel. It was impossible to tell where it led, since only the first few feet were visible. Beyond that, only darkness. I took a breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d I told them.\n \t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Deli asked.\n \t\u201cYes,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I need to get to those wells.\u201d \n\nI had started to lower myself down into the dark hole when Soy grabbed my arm.\n\n\u201cCal,\u201d he said with a concerned voice.\n \t\u201cYeah, Soy?\u201d I asked with a smile.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s just, if there\u2019s something horrible down there\u2026 make sure you yell up really loudly, so I know not to follow you,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cSure, Soy,\u201d I answered without the smile. \n \t\u201cI\u2019ll be mad if you don\u2019t,\u201d he added. \n\nDeli rolled her eyes. \n\n\u201cRocketship underwear,\u201d I thought to myself. \n\nI dangled my legs over the edge first. When I finally let go of my grip, I immediately regretted it. I had counted on the tunnel walls curving beneath me, but they went straight down. I started falling fast, not sure if I was screaming out loud or just in my head. \n\nI could barely think at all. I\u2019d never fallen so far in my life and had no idea what was waiting for me at the bottom. The tunnel seemed to go on forever. Finally, I started to scrape the sides with my back. More and more of my back touched the tunnel, slowing me down. The walls got smoother and took most of my weight. My fall had turned into a slide, and I was starting to level out. The ride ended when I was ejected out onto a landing. There was a rich purple lake glowing in front of me. The lake was the only source of light, showing off a stubby, wooden dock that jutted out over the liquid. \n\nI thought that I must be deeper underground than I had ever been before. It was hard to tell how long I had been falling. My guess was somewhere around three minutes. I called back into the tunnel, not knowing if Deli and Soy had any shot of hearing me. \n\n\u201cHello! Deli! Soy! I\u2019m OK!\u201d I yelled.\n \tTo my utter surprise, I could hear them like they were only a few feet away. \n\n\u201cWhat took you so long to say something, then?\u201d Soy asked suspiciously. \n\n\u201cBecause...I was falling,\u201d I said. \u201c\u2026For a while,\u201d I thought.\n \t\u201cAre there monsters with you?\u201d he asked.\n \t\u201cNo, Soy. Come down and bring Deli, but be careful on the way down.\u201d \n\nI could hear him whisper to Deli, \u201cSee, but that\u2019s exactly what a monster would make him say.\u201d \n\nI decided to use the acoustic phenomenon to my advantage.\n \t\u201cSoy, you can hear how close I am. If there were monsters you\u2019d hear them too,\u201d I said. \"Just jump down. I can still see you from where I am.\u201d \n\nEventually, Deli convinced Soy that it was worth the risk. They jumped in after me. \n\n18. SEBASTIEN.\nI didn\u2019t have to wonder how long the fall was after that. I listened to Soy scream at the top of his lungs for about two minutes before he was deposited on the ground in front of me, with Deli on his stomach. She looked as though she had actually enjoyed the experience. \n\n\u201cSee, now that\u2019s the kind of fun we should be having more of!\u201d she said.\n Soy pointed his fingers at both of us and said, \u201cYou, Cal, are a liar. And royalty or not, you, are a weird little frog.\u201d \n\nDeli hopped up towards the dock and inspected the lake. \n\n\u201cOh, my!\" she gasped.\n \t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked worriedly.\n \tDeli replied, \"This lake has rooze in it. It\u2019s the waste that\u2019s left over when rile and lore are used in large quantities. It occurs naturally, but there\u2019s a reason why it is buried so deep in the mountain. As legend goes, it turns anything it touches into food for magical creatures.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat are you saying? It could transform us into dragon food?\u201d asked Soy.\n \t\u201cOr warlug food or troll food or ogre food. The legend doesn\u2019t really specify,\u201d she answered.\n\nI looked across the huge lake and saw another spot of land. It was the only other one in sight. It led to a bright purple door. \n\n\u201cThere,\u201d I said pointing. \u201cThat\u2019s where we need to go.\u201d\n \t\u201cGreat. And did you happen to hear about the lake of death in front of us, just waiting to turn us into a Cal and Soy smoothie?\u201d Soy answered with frustration.\n \t\u201cI can assist with that,\" someone said. \n\nThe voice we heard came from the dock. A small metal boat had appeared without us noticing. It was towing an even smaller dinghy (the size of a milk crate). A thin rope connected the two. \n\nThe voice belonged to a short creature who could barely see over the sides of his boat. His ears rose a few inches above his head, and his pointy snout had silver whiskers. He held a large oar that was at least three times his size. He stepped up and stood on the bow of the boat to reveal himself fully. The grey fuzz on his body seemed to ruffle in a breeze from the lake. There was no way around what I was seeing. This was an abnormally large, talking mouse. \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Deli forcefully.\n \t\u201cI am Sebastien. I row the boat from this side to that, waiting for passengers,\u201d he answered calmly. \n\nSoy mouthed the word \u201cmouse\u201d at me and pointed towards Sebastien. \n\n\u201cAnd how many passengers have you had down here?\u201d I asked.\n \tSebastien looked at me with his beady eyes and gave a smirk. \u201cYou will be my first.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re gonna need to revisit that whole \u2018animals don\u2019t talk\u2019 thing,\u201d said Soy to Deli.\n\nThere was no way across without his boat. That much was clear. Without a word, I stepped inside. It only wobbled a little, but it was enough to make me uneasy. Sebastien held us steady by keeping his paw on the dock. \n\n\u201cCareful now, we wouldn\u2019t want you falling in,\u201d he said with a hint of amusement.\n \t\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d I said to Deli and Soy, \u201cand there\u2019s no turning back now.\u201d\n \t\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201c said Deli, and she hopped aboard.\n \tSoy followed slowly, looking around the boat, and then staring at Sebastien through squinted eyes. Now that we were closer, I could smell the rooze. It smelled like raspberries that had gone bad. Real bad. In fact, if \u201czombie raspberries\u201d were a thing, they would smell like rooze.\n\n\u201cWhat do you eat out here, rowing back and forth all day long?\u201d Soy asked him, still suspicious.\n\nSebastien pushed off with his oar and began turning the boat towards the other side of the lake. The smaller boat followed behind as we moved forward. \n\n\u201cI do not require much food,\u201d he answered.\n \tSebastien rowed us steadily out into the open water, alternating sides with his oar.\n \t\u201cAnd what do we owe you for the trip?\u201d asked Deli.\n \tI hadn\u2019t thought of that. If Sebastien set a price too steep, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do. \n\n\u201cThere is no cost, Princess,\u201d he answered. \u201cI ask only for your company.\u201d \n\nHe had called Deli \u201cPrincess\u201d, and we had all heard it. I didn\u2019t know what that meant, but it definitely meant something. Soy was glaring at Sebastien through even smaller eyes. A few minutes later we had reached what I thought was the center of the lake. I could tell because the light glowed brightest there, like a chandelier.\n\n\u201cHey, Sebastien,\u201d Soy said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some crackers for you in my pocket if you get us there faster.\u201d \n\nSebastien plunged his oar beneath the surface, and the boat stopped dead. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t get you there faster. In fact, I can\u2019t get you there at all,\u201d Sebastien said, turning around to face us. \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Soy said with concern, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by it. You can row whatever speed you\u2019d like. Just\u2026 definitely keep rowing.\u201d\n \t\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d he replied, \u201cbut, there is a leak in the boat, and we cannot continue.\u201d \n\nSebastien pointed to the middle of the boat. All of a sudden, the purple liquid started to seep into the boat from a hole too small to see. Soy and Deli jumped toward the front with Sebastien, and I scrambled to the back. The putrid smell added to my panic. \n\nThe rooze was filling the boat more and more by the second. Deli jumped onto Soy\u2019s shoulders, and we both lifted our feet onto the wooden planks meant for sitting. Sebastien didn\u2019t move. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I shouted, \u201cThere must be something you can do, Sebastien!\u201d \n\n\u201cThere is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut only for one of you. The dinghy behind us can fit a single soul. Anything more, no matter the size, and it will sink into the lake forever.\u201d \n\nI stared at Deli and Soy from across the boat. They were scared. I was scared, too. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be you,\u201d said Deli. \"You\u2019re the only one who can stop Ream.\u201d \n\nSoy looked at me with a sad smile, and nodded. \n\n\u201cI know you can do it,\u201d he said.\n\nMy eyes started to water. I looked at the liquid pouring in and shook my head. Then I turned to look at the dinghy behind me. Finally, I looked back at my friends. \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I said, staring right at Sebastien. \u201cI won\u2019t do it. I won\u2019t leave them. This is not how the story ends.\u201d\n\nSebastien stared back at me with fierce eyes. Then gave way to a great big smile. \n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said laying down his oar. Sebastien jumped down from his perch and landed directly in the purple pool before us. It disappeared in a puff of smoke. \n\n\u201cA fine choice,\u201d he continued. \"It is true that my dinghy can only take one soul, but that soul is me, and only me.\u201d \n\nHe strode past me, walking on the wooden planks inside the boat, and then jumped inside his dinghy. \n\n\u201cHad you chosen to leave them, you would have perished in the lake,\u201d Sebastien said as he undid the rope connecting us. \"Good luck, Cal, and remember one thing: you were chosen for a reason.\u201d\n \t\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what else to say. It was all so confusing. By the time I grabbed the oar at the front of the boat, Sebastien was out of sight. I felt Soy pat me on the back as I started rowing. \n\n\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t leave us,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t,\u201d I replied, wiping my eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much of a hero without you two.\u201d\n\nI quickly realized why Sebastien had been rowing so slowly. Any faster and I would risk sending drops from the lake back at my friends. I wasn\u2019t sure what Sebastien\u2019s role was in all of this, but I wondered if I had misjudged him. \n\nIt took about ten minutes to reach the dock on the far side of the lake. The two landings were identical, except that in place of a tunnel, this one had an archway with large purple double-doors. Two flaming torches burned on either side. Just like the doors before, there was a carving in the center. This one was a dwarf. Ok, so maybe, I had never seen a dwarf, but it couldn\u2019t really be anything else. The figure had a long braided beard and a wide, brawny face. He held a hammer and a small shovel in his crossed arms. Two of my favorite tools. \n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d I said aloud.\n \t\u201cI don\u2019t know what will be on the other side,\u201d Deli warned. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to know anyway,\u201d said Soy. \n\nWith a push from all three of us, the doors swung open. \n\n19. THE WELLS.\nThe cavern we entered was about half the size of the entire Stagwood Elementary. I walked forward and felt the dirt and stones crunching underneath. There was no telling how long it had been since someone, anyone had set foot there. To our right was a deep hole with a simple wooden support standing over it. Attached to the crank, a rope was hanging from down, disappearing into the hole. Whatever was inside was glowing the same orange as the shield over my flying bed. To the left there was a similar hole, except that it glowed red. \n\n\tI had been picturing wells like the ones I had seen in pictures, but these looked much older. Ancient even.\n\n\u201cRed is for rile,\u201d Deli told us.\n\nThat meant the orange well was for lore. \n\nThe room was wide open, without anything of note besides the wells. And after our last few run-ins, it\u2019s safe to say we were happy that there wasn\u2019t a creature in sight. There was, however, another plate in the center of the floor though. It sat directly between the wells, and read: \n\nRemember what\u2019s been found and learned. \n\nThe pen is not a gift, but earned.\n\nThe safest place to hide creation:\n\nHands that lack imagination. \n\n\u201cGreat\u2026 another riddle. Cal, you figured out the last one. What does this one mean?\u201d Soy asked me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d I replied. \n\nWe searched around, looking for the pen under every rock and inside every crack. There was no sign of it. \n\n\u201cHow do we even know it\u2019s in here?\u201d I asked Deli.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in here,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhere then?\u201d Soy asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s down another hole, I quit. We\u2019re going to reach the other side of the world pretty soon.\u201d \n\nIt hit me right away. \n\n\u201cSoy! You\u2019re brilliant!\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cI know. Why?\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cThere are two holes here already, and we haven\u2019t checked them,\u201d I said. \n\nDeli gave a smile. \u201cOf course!\u201d she said. \n\nI ran over to the Well of Lore, grabbed the handle, and started turning the crank. The rope creaked and groaned as it crawled up towards us. Soy grabbed the handle to help. Deli hopped to the edge of the hole to peer down. \n\n\u201cI see it!\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bucket coming up!\u201d \n\nBy the time I saw the bucket, I was already sure. There was nothing inside. We finished pulling it up, anyway.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d asked Soy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still one more to check,\u201d I said. \n\nSoy shuddered. \u201cThe rile one? Do we have to?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d I said.\n\nWe went over to the Well of Rile and started cranking again. This time the crank turned much slower. Soy and I were both getting tired when Deli called out. \n\n\u201cI see another bucket,\u201d she said. \n\nI kept cranking, but the muscles in my arms had started to burn. The bucket lurched into sight.\n\n\u201cKeep going. This one looks different!\u201d Deli said excitedly. \n\nWhen I looked down, I agreed that the inside of this bucket did look different. Something was moving inside. The last few feet were the hardest. When the bucket was finally within reach, I took it off the worn metal hook and set it down carefully next to us. \n\nThe inside of the bucket was bad news. Awful even. It was filled to the brim with purple rooze. Except this time, the rooze was much thicker and darker. The smell was overwhelming. \n\n\u201cMore of that rooze stuff,\u201d Soy complained. \n\n\u201cThis looks stronger,\u201d said Deli.\n\nThe pen had to be inside. The words of the riddle floated through my head. \n\nRemember what\u2019s been found and learned. \n\nWhat had I learned? I had learned that dwarves liked to hide things underground. Soy had already reminded me of that a moment ago. But it wouldn\u2019t help here.\n\nI had also learned that this mountain was filled with tricks (like tunnels that are long and short at the same time). And I had learned from the boat that sometimes making the more dangerous choice is the only thing that will save you. That\u2019s when it hit me. The words gained meaning and I knew what I had to do. I was starting to like these rhyming riddles. \n\nI reached my hand inside the bucket with my right arm, past the surface of the thick rooze.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing??\u201d yelled Soy.\n\nI kept reaching until my hand hit the bottom. I expected to feel the pen, and the rooze to disappear like it had in the boat. Neither happened.\n\nSoy put his heads to his head. \u201cTake it out of there or you\u2019ll be monster food!\u201d\n\n\u201cCal!\u201d cried Deli, with wide eyes.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nThe rooze started traveling up my right arm, covering it. And it didn\u2019t stop there. It oozed across my chest. It felt cold and hot at the same time. It made it\u2019s way to my left arm, then down to my wrist.\n\n\u201cGet it off him!\u201d shouted Soy, batting at my arm with his hands.\n\nBut when the rooze settled on my left hand it started to condense. It was being pulled and concentrated into my palm, until it formed a new shape. Much smaller. More solid. \n\nWhen it stopped, I knew without looking that I was holding a pen. \n\n20. THE PEN AND THE SWORD.\nJust as the pen appeared, we heard fluttering from behind us. Two grey stones came alive and took off in flight out the door.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked Soy.\n \t\u201cI think we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d answered Deli. \n\nWith a great swooping noise, the low purple light from the lake was blocked by an enormous figure. The huge, shiny talons on Ream's feet clinked on the ground as he landed. Ducking below the archway, he approached the three of us. He was flanked on both sides by dozens and dozens of fairies. \n\nThe fairies looked similar in shape to the ones in Pavidale, but they were not the same. They had no color, only greyness, and moved like they were made of stone. When their wings flapped, they left a trail of dull chalk. These was no brightness or happiness about them.\n\n\u201cSo, Cal,\u201d bellowed Ream, \u201cit seems that you\u2019ve finally lived up to your story.\u201d\n \t\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d demanded Deli. \n\nReam slowly circled us as he spoke, kicking up dirt and dust.\n\n\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t hard once you showed me the right door. I see now that it was under my claws this whole time. To think how many fairies I wasted on those other doors. Oh, well,\u201d he said leaning in closer, \u201cthey were only fairies after all.\u201d \n\nDeli was angry.\n \t\u201cHow dare you!\u201d she shouted.\n \t\u201cHush now, Delilah. There are more important things to worry about. Like how I will roast your new little friend if he doesn\u2019t hand over the pen.\u201d\n \t\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d shouted a voice from behind Ream. \n\nThe moment I heard it, I knew that it was the voice of the one fairy who might be able to get us out of this mess. \n\n\u201cTryt!\u201d I yelled.\n \tTryt came flying in straight past Ream and settled in front of us. \n\n\u201cI followed you here to make sure that nothing went wrong,\u201d he said.\n \t\u201cWell, thank goodness you did,\u201d said Deli. \u201cReam was about to turn us into a meal.\u201d\n \tTryt turned with a smile and said, \u201cOh, he wouldn\u2019t do that. I gave him strict orders not to damage the pen.\u201d \n\nThe words cut me as they settled in. \n\n\u201cYou\u2026 gave him orders?\u201d said Deli.\n \t\u201cThat\u2019s right, Delilah,\" Tryt declared. \"Ream has been a valuable ally to me.\u201d \n\nReam let out a fiery laugh. \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever wonder how I was able to steal your fairy friends? Or how I knew you\u2019d be in the dark cloud before you even got there?\u201d Ream said with amusement.\n \t\u201cYes,\" Tryt responded, \"I sent them straight to you, Ream, so that you could get rid of Deli and the sidekick, but you didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d \n\nReam\u2019s toothy smile faded. \n\n\u201cNo matter, there\u2019s nothing they can do to stop us now, anyway,\u201d said Tryt.\n \t\u201cYou betrayed your friends. How could you?\u201d screamed Deli.\n \t\u201cFairies don\u2019t matter. The Author Pen is all that matters,\u201d said Tryt. \n\nSuddenly, it all clicked. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the fairy from the story, the one who told the king about the wells,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cI thought he was the one who was hiding like a tiny baby?\u201d remarked Soy.\n \t\u201cI was both of them, you fool. And I wasn\u2019t hiding!\u201d shouted Tryt. \u201cI was following the dwarves as part of my plan. I used the king and those stubborn dwarves to help me find the wells. But once they did, I couldn\u2019t convince them to give me the pen. At least not the important one. The one that showed the wells\u2019 true power. The pen meant for a king! Instead, they gave me this.\u201d Tryt pulled out the pen he had used to write my story. \u201cThe pen of a servant.\u201d\n \t\u201cAnd\u2026 Ream?\u201d Deli asked sadly.\n \t\u201cA means to an end. When I learned there was a dragon powerful enough to enslave elves, I knew that he was my best chance. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t have you defeat him. I warned him of your impending attack, and he was able to escape.\u201d\n\nReam snarled.\n\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d Deli leapt forward. A handful of fairies flew up and intercepted her before she could reach Tryt.\n \t\u201cYou see the advantage of an army,\" Tryt said with a laugh. \u201cYou see, you freed the elves when you hit him with your arrow, but he kept his rile. Power strong enough to build a new army, for me. An army made for one purpose: to find the Author Pen. I thought an army of fairies would be useful, but it turns out they were better than I could have imagined. When Ream started stealing fairies, he threatened the existence of fairytales, and a hero was chosen. \u2018Dire need\u2019, as they say. I had hoped Ream would be able to find the pen without Cal, but the dwarves were craftier than I expected. But no matter. We are here now, and the Author Pen is within my grasp, thanks to all of you.\u201d\n\nThe pen burned in my hand. I had done exactly what they had wanted me to do. I had led Ream and Tryt and their army of fairies right to the most powerful tool in the world. \n\n\u201cIt was a brilliant plan, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d asked Tryt boastfully.\n \t\u201cPeople don\u2019t like it when you call your own ideas brilliant,\u201d Soy interrupted.\n \tDeli and I turned to face him.\n \t\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019ve been told that a lot,\u201d he said softly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for you, then?\u201d I asked, turning to Ream, desperate for a way out of all this. \n\n\u201cOh, not much, just control of all the humans,\u201d he said with a grin that crawled under my skin. \n\n\u201cWith just one swipe of a pen, I will make it so. I have little use for them,\u201d said Tryt. \n\nDeli tried to jump free, but no luck. Soy looked at me and motioned with his eyes that he was ready to charge Tryt. I shook my head slightly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d noticed Tryt, \u201cbut I'm afraid you won\u2019t be a match for an army of fairies and the most powerful dragon ever known. Now hand the pen over, and I will consider letting you leave here in one piece, Cal. I will keep Soy as my own personal servant, however, and teach him some manners\u2026 the hard way.\u201d \n\nThis wasn\u2019t right. I had promised Soy that I\u2019d get him out of this trouble- that I\u2019d get us all out of this. But at that moment, I didn\u2019t see how. I thought back to the poem. I scrolled through it in my mind, looking for anything that I might have missed, and there it was. The second stanza: \n\nThe safest place to hide creation: \n\nHands that lack imagination. \n\nIt was the only verse that hadn\u2019t made sense yet. If the answer I needed wasn\u2019t in those words, then I was lost. I started with the first line. If creation meant the Author Pen, then we had already found where it was hidden. Hadn\u2019t we? But we had found it at the bottom of the Well of Rile. That didn\u2019t sound much like a hand to me. And, as far as I could tell, imagination didn\u2019t play any part in it. I was out of ideas, and I was out of time. Tryt stepped in front of me, with Ream at his back. \n\n\u201cThe Author Pen. Give it to me now,\u201d he said. \n\nTryt reached out his palm towards me. I stared at his pink hand\u2026 \n\nThe riddle. \n\nI understood.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll trade you,\u201d I offered.\n \t\u201cWhat?\u201d Ream asked.\n \t\u201cGive me the Fairytale Pen, and I will give you mine,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cWhy would I give you any\u2026\u201d started Tryt, but before he could finish, I held the pen out over the Well of Rile.\n\nTryt took a step back in fear.\n \t\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll drop the pen. Do you know what happens when a magic pen is dropped into a well of rile? Because I don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cIf you do, I will roast every last one of you!\u201d shouted Ream.\n \tTryt closed his eyes for a moment and raised his hand to silence the dragon. \u201cNo need, my fiery friend. He can have the Fairytale Pen. It seems fitting for him to be the one to write down the terrible tales to come. Here,\u201d Tryt said, as he tossed the Fairytale Pen to me. \u201cNow hand over the pen before I get angry.\u201d\n \t\u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d shouted Soy. \n\nBut I did. I withdrew the pen from over the well and tossed it to Tryt. He caught it with a flutter. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s finally mine!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cSend in the book!\u201d \n\nGrey fairies flew into the room carrying the Book of Lore that I had seen back in Pavidale, when things seemed so different, and Tryt was still on our side. Tryt flew off to the edge of the room and set to work on the book. \n\n\u201cShall I finish the frog off?\u201d asked Ream.\n \t\u201cNot yet. I want her to see this,\u201d answered Tryt as he opened the book to the pages of my fairytale. \n\nDeli looked at me with sad eyes. \n\n\u201cOh, Cal. We\u2019ve failed,\" she sobbed.\n \tI shook my head and told her, \u201cNobody writes my story but me.\u201d \n\nI heard an angry clamor echoing in the great cavern.\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s not working! Why isn\u2019t it working!\u201d Tryt screamed. \n\n21. THE HERO.\nI opened my hand and looked at the pen that Tryt had been so ready to give up. I wished harder than I ever had before that I was right. Lifting the pen, I started to write in mid-air. \n\nThe first stroke gave off a few sparks, almost too few to notice. But the next stroke made a brilliant line of orange as clear as day. \n\nReam had taken notice. \n\n\u201cTryt, did you know that your pen could do that?\u201d Ream asked.\n \t\u201cI\u2019m busy!\u201d shouted Tryt, still struggling to write in the book. \u201cWhy won\u2019t it let me write what I want!\u201d \n\nThe words started coming to me and didn\u2019t stop, as I wrote in the air:\n\nThe fairies that the dragon stole, \n\nWere all set free from his control. \n\nThe stone fairies started to shed the chalky greyness off their bodies. Their original colors started to shine through. Ream took a step back. The fairies flapped their wings, removing the last remnants of grey, and flew toward the dragon. Soon they had him on the ground, holding his mouth shut to prevent him from breathing fire. \n\nThe commotion got Tryt\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he shouted. \n\nThat\u2019s when he saw my words, etched in the air. They were moving now, towards Tryt. But instead of hitting him, they flew into the book leaving a trail of smoke. \n\n\u201cHow did you do that?!\u201d asked Deli. \n\nTryt tried desperately to write in the air as I had, but nothing happened. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it! You\u2019re using the wrong pen!\u201d he screeched.\n \t\u201cNo, Tryt. You are.\u201d\n\nTryt\u2019s face twisted.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean??\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you might find the answer in the beginning of your book,\u201d I said.\n\nTryt flipped to the first tale of the book, the one that had always been locked. But this time, with the true Fairytale Pen in his hand, he was finally able to turn the pages. \n\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d asked Soy.\n \tTryt read the tale, with fire in his eyes, as I explained, \u201cIt tells the story of the King of the Mountain and his siblings. And Tryt, following the dwarves to find the wells for himself.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou mean the dwarves knew?\u201d asked Deli.\n \t\u201cThey must have, because they kept the true Fairytale Pen here in the wells, the one that tells the stories of good and evil. They knew that Tryt would stop at nothing to find the Author Pen, so they kept its identity secret.\u201d\n \t\u201cThis can't be!\" Tryt wailed.\n \tI continued, \u201cThey hid it in the safest place they could think of ...in hands that lack imagination. Your hands, Tryt.\u201d\n \t\u201cAll this time, I had the pen! And I never knew?!\u201d Tryt moaned.\n \t\u201cOf course!\u201d said Deli. \u201cHe values power more than anything, so he couldn\u2019t fathom that the dwarves had given it to him freely\u2026 but you could,\u201d she said as she turned to me.  \n\nTryt began to shake with fury.\n\n\u201cGive it me!\u201d he shouted, and flew straight for me. \n\nBefore he could reach me, Soy stepped in front and caught Tryt mid-air. He held him down against the ground.\n \t\u201cYou don\u2019t fly at my friend!\u201d said Soy, \u201cIt lacks\u2026 manners.\u201d \n\nI quickly wrote in the air above his head. \n\nThe fairy\u2019s magic left forever, \n\nImmediately Tryt's pink glow began to fade until his skin was a pale white. \n\n\u201cWhat have you done to me? You can\u2019t!\u201d he protested. \n\nI thought for a moment, then finished the line. \n\nTackled by a boy more clever. \n\nSoy gave me a huge smile as he read the words. Tryt spit and sputtered under him. Then I turned my attention to Ream, who was still struggling against the fairies. \n\nI wrote: \n\nThe dragon lost his breath and flight, \n\nI had written it just in time. Ream burst out from beneath the fairies, and turned towards us with his mouth wide open. But only air came out.\n\n\u201cWhat, what did you do to me?\u201d he said. In his anger he hurtled towards me. \n\nNever more to start a fight. \n\nThe dragon stopped in his tracks.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be causing trouble anymore, Ream. Neither of you will,\u201d I added as I glared at Tryt. I took another few moments to think, and then I started writing in the sky again: \n\nThe stolen fairies, safe and sound, \n\nThose they lost would now be found. \n\nThe fairies zipped out of the room towards the other side of the lake. I knew they\u2019d be headed straight for Pavidale. And if I had done it right, every fairy who had been sent through those dark cloud doors would be there waiting for them. That thought gave me another idea.\n\nThe dragon and his fairy friend, \n\nWere sent away at story\u2019s end, \n\nTo live inside a darkened cloud, \n\nWhere only warlugs are allowed. \n\nAll at once, Tryt was flung from Soy\u2019s grip straight into Ream\u2019s stomach (who was being tugged away much slower). \n\n\u201cThis is not over!\u201d said Tryt as he and Ream were dragged by an invisible force. \n\nReam didn\u2019t say a word. He just smiled a toothy grin at me as they were swept from the room. \n\nMy words floated in the air for another second, then flew inside the book. The moment they did, there was an orange flash behind me. Soy and I turned around to see that Deli was the source of it. She had changed. She was no longer a frog. In fact, she was about as far from a frog as you could get. Deli was a tall, pretty elf with long dark hair and pointy ears. Her glasses surrounded big brown eyes and freckled cheeks. Without them, I might not have known it was her. \n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d said Soy. \n\nShe gave us both a warm smile.\n\n\u201cThank you! Oh, thank you!\u201d Deli said as she ran over and gave us a hug. \n When she pulled away I noticed that she was wearing braces. I guessed they must\u2019ve been hard to see when she was frog.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 you\u2019re young. I thought you\u2019ve been around for a long time,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cI have been,\" she said, \u201cbut elves age differently than humans. I\u2019m still a teenager in elf years. That\u2019s why I have to wear these braces. \u2018One day that hero will come along and turn you back into an elf, so you\u2019d better take care of your teeth, frog or not!\u2019 my dad is always saying. He\u2019s the King of the Elves,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRight, of course,\u201d I remembered. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201clet\u2019s get out of here before something else happens!\u201d \n\n \n\n22. THE LAKE. \nSebastien was waiting for us at the dock. This time there was no dinghy behind his boat. \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asked, \u201chow\u2019d it go? Saw an awful lot of fairies and one big dragon leaving in a hurry over my lake.\u201d\n \t\u201cIt went all right,\u201d Soy said modestly. \u201cI got to tackle an evil fairy.\u201d\n \t\u201cGood for you,\u201d said Sebastien sincerely.  \n\nWe started for the other side of the lake.\n \t\u201cWhat are you going to do with the pen?\u201d asked Soy with excitement. \n\nThe pens and the Book of Lore were sitting next to me. \n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s only right to return the book and the real Fairytale Pen back to the fairies,\u201d I said.\n \t\u201cNo, not that pen. I mean the Author Pen. You can use it to create anything you want! You saw what it did back there!\u201d Soy was getting more and more animated as he spoke.\n \t\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it,\u201d I answered.\n \t\u201cInstead of just doodling you could be creating entire cities! Kingdoms! The possibilities are endless!\u201d Soy said.\n\nDeli placed her hand over mine.\n \t\u201cWhat do you think you should do with it?\u201d she asked kindly. \n\nI looked at Sebastien. He was watching me intently, as well. \n\nHis words were running through my head. \u201cYou were chosen for a reason.\u201d Deli had said that I thought differently than Tryt, and that was why I discovered the identity of the Author Pen. But that couldn\u2019t be all. Maybe I was chosen so that I could put the pen to good use. There was so much that I could do with it. But\u2026 that didn\u2019t seem like the answer either. \n\nInstead of just recording tales in the Book of Lore, Tryt could have been using the pen to create his own version of things. There\u2019s no telling what he would have done if he had known. In their cleverness, the dwarves had tricked him, to conceal the pen\u2019s identity. Above all else, they wanted it protected. And in a way, they were the ones who had chosen me to do it. The needed someone to find the pen who would know what to do with it once the story was over. And I did. \n\nI picked the pen out of my pocket and wrote one last note in small letters, covering it with my other hand. I waited until the words were safely inside the book, then reached my hand out over the side of the boat. I shut my eyes and dropped the pen into the lake. \n\nDeli let out a laugh and gave me a hug.\n \t\u201cWhat? What?... But\u2026What?\u201d was all that Soy could say. \n\nSebastien smirked at me and continued rowing.\n\nSoy let out a sigh. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t get it, but I don\u2019t get most of this, anyway.\u201d \n\nSoon we were on the other side of the lake. Sebastien pulled us up to the dock and held the boat steady as we stepped out. \n\n\u201cHow will we get back up?\u201d I asked him.\n \t\u201cSame way you got down,\u201d he answered.\n \t\u201cThank you!\u201d I said as we all waved goodbye.\n \t\u201cIt was my pleasure. Best fare I ever had,\u201d Sebastien said with a wink. \n\nHe disappeared into a purple mist before I could respond. When we approached the tunnel again, I still didn\u2019t know what Sebastien had meant. \n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018same way you got down\u2019,\u201d Deli repeated. \n\nAs I stuck my hand past the opening, felt something odd. There was a gravity inside the hole, pulling me in, same as from the other direction.\n\n\u201cSoy,\u201d I said, \u201ctry to enjoy it this time.\u201d \n\nI jumped forward and was immediately falling again- this time upside down. A few minutes later, I was tossed up and into the cave room with the five animal doors. I noticed that the doors were all open and calm. \n\nThe only stirring was far away at the bottom of the cloud beyond the middle door. I peered through, down from the top of the cloud. There was a golden dragon and a fairy, surrounded by a circle of warlugs. Moments later, Soy and Deli popped out of the tunnel. I closed the door shut. \n\nOutside the entrance of the mountain, my bed was waiting for us. It was nice to see it again. I probably could have fallen asleep on it right then and there, but I knew there was a lot of traveling left to do, so I climbed on top and took my spot up front. \n\n\u201cHey Deli,\u201d I asked, \u201cdo you know a good place for three heroes to celebrate after an adventure?\u201d\n \t\u201cI do,\u201d she responded with a smile. \n\nAnd with that, we set off for Pavidale on my flying bed.\n\nEPILOGUE 1 \nI pressed the SQUEEZE button and felt the bed pinch. With a few more clicks, I was lying in my bed in my room on Windfall Drive. I pulled the pillow and phone hard until they popped out, and then put them back where they belonged. It was a normal bed again, at least for now. I laid down my head, wanting to fall asleep. It felt strange to be back, but I didn\u2019t have much time to dwell on it. \n\n\tI could hear my mom on the phone downstairs. \n\n\u201cWhere could they be?\u201d she asked frantically.\n \t\u201cWe\u2019ll go looking again in the morning. Maybe they went camping,\u201d my dad said, trying to hide his own concern.\n \t\u201cThey ran away from school, took all of the food and a bed to go camping? Who takes a bed camping?!\u201d my mother cried.\n \t\u201cThey\u2019re kids, they don\u2019t know how to camp. Heck, I don\u2019t even know how to camp,\u201d my father said. \n\nI called down to them, \u201cMom! Dad!\u201d\n\nThey ran upstairs in no time at all and threw open my door. \u201cCal! You\u2019re okay!\u201d they said, hugging me fiercely. \n\n\u201cOf course I am. Soy and I were out camping is all,\" I said, too tired to think of a different excuse. My dad gave my mom a knowing grin and a nudge. She was not amused. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean camping?! How did you get your bed up here?! What were you thinking? You are more grounded than you\u2019ve ever been in your entire life!\u201d my mom said without taking a breath.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok dear, he\u2019s here and he\u2019s safe,\u201d said my dad trying to calm her. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re ok,\u201d she said hugging me again. \u201cBut you are in so much trouble. You don\u2019t even know,\u201d she said squeezing me even harder.\n\nI knew that she meant it. \n\n\u201cYou look exhausted. We\u2019ll deal with this in the morning. Dad will guard your door tonight to make sure that you don\u2019t sneak out again.\u201d \n\nNow my dad was the one who didn\u2019t look amused. I was in trouble and there was nothing I could do about it. Still, as I drifted off to sleep, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if there was any way to fish a magic pen out of a rooze lake. \n\nEPILOGUE 2 \n\t\u201cSoy, were you out with Cal? His mom left me a bunch of frantic messages,\u201d Soy\u2019s mom asked while microwaving some dinner.\n \t\u201cYeah, I told you, we went on a mission to save the world. You never listen to me!\u201d he shouted back at her from up the stairs. \n\n\u201cOkay then, sorry dear,\u201d she said calmly.\n \tA few seconds later she heard a loud commotion. \n\n\u201cMOM!\u201d he yelled.\n \t\u201cWhat is it Soy?\u201d she shouted back. \n\nThen came the excited footsteps of Soy barreling down the stairs. When he appeared in the kitchen, he was holding an enormous pile of clothes taller than his head. \n\n\u201cLook!\u201d he shouted. \n\nSoy dropped one hundred pairs of rocketship underwear onto the kitchen floor.  \n\nEPILOGUE 3 \nMonths had passed since our adventure. I was only allowed out of the house for school. My hopes were high that someday soon I\u2019d be released from my punishment. Deli had been away with the elves. She couldn\u2019t tell us what it was about, but she assured us that she\u2019d be back soon. Soy and I didn\u2019t say it out loud, but neither of us could wait to see her again.\n\nI was sitting in class drawing again, listening to another lecture from Miss Weaver. \n\n\u201cThe first capital of the United States was actually Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Speaking of which, did I ever tell you that the quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles was actually a former student of mine?\u201d she began to repeat.\n\nEver since we visited Pavidale a second time, my daydreams were all about clouds. Some of the time I would doodle the inside of a cloud with lore, like Pavidale, but different. It was somewhere that seemed even farther away. Most times I would draw the inside of a single dark cloud. Every time I did, the inside was a bit different. Structures appeared where there didn\u2019t used to be anything, and little by little it seemed to look more\u2026 organized.\n\nThat\u2019s when a small ball of paper landed on my desk. Then another hit the right side of my face. I looked across my row and saw Soy staring at me. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I mouthed.\n \t\u201cLow cow hair,\u201d he mouthed back.\n \t\u201cWhat?\u201d I said with a shake of my head.\n \t\u201cLook. Out. There.\u201d he mouthed again, pointing to the window next to me. \n\nThere was a squirrel sitting on the windowsill. It might be nothing, I thought. Squirrels run around the yard all the time. But, when I looked again, there was no mistaking it, this squirrel was staring inside the classroom, right at me. \n\nWhat were the odds that this would be happening again? It probably doesn\u2019t mean anything, I thought. \n\nUntil I saw its watch.", "title": "THE GUARDIANS OF LORE\n"}, {"id": 4, "text": "By the African river, know as the Nile,\nThe sun fell away and it rested a while.\n\nThe rhinos had braved all the smoldering heat.\nThey lay down to sleep as they wiped off their feet.\n\nThe elephants marched to their elephant beds,\nAnd gently they rested their elephant heads.\n\nThe hippos went bathing in cool, shallow pools,\nThinking the rhinos and elephants fools.\n\nSlowly the hippos sank into the river,\nThe water so cold that it gave them a shiver.\n\n(Hippos can't swim, like the pelicans think.\nThey also can't float- they could easily sink.)\n\nUnderwater, they fell to the soft river bed,\nOn darkish green plants with a smidgen of red.\n\nThey strolled on the bottom, then bounced up for air.\nThey did it for hours, without any care.\n\nThe fish followed closely, and wove in an out,\nUnder their belly, and up to their snout.\n\nEach of the hippos came up to the shore,\nTo feed on the grass by the river once more.\n\nThey dried off their bodies by shaking and stomping,\nAnd took bites of grass, chewing and chomping.\n\nWith night fading fast, they were full from the feast.\nThe sun returned back, rising up from the east.\n\nThe hippos crept off to collapse for the day,\nWhile rhinos and elephants got up to play.\n\nEnjoying the warmth of the sun and its light,\nNever knowing the story of hippos at night.", "title": "WHEN DO HIPPOS PLAY?\n"}, {"id": 5, "text": "\n\"Hi! My name is Samantha and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like television, cellular phones, men on the Moon, space exporation, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don't understand everything about them yet.\nI also wonder about smaller things like-why do my doll's eyes close when I lay her down and open when I pick her up. Or how are cartoons made? Hmm - I know it has something to do with science.\nMy brother Samuel wants to be a scientist too, but he likes things I that I don't, like-why stalactites grow.\nBut even though we don't like the same things it's still science so we get along just fine. In facct, our teacher's help us better understand Math, technology, current events and trends - all of which are important. We even help each other and have lots of fun.\nI like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something. I could get hurt. Sometimes it's best to start small, and that's just what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. I had to do an optical illusion. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it's the basis for making cartoons - and here is why.\nOur brains fill in the gaps for whatever our eyes aren't proccessing. So two different pictures can actually become one or still images can appear to be moving. Try this experiment it's lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it. Here is what you need:\n- 2 small pieces of white cardboard or index cards\n- Tape\n- A pencil to be used as a shaft\n- Crayons, colored pencils or whatever you want to draw with\nThe Experiment Preparations:\n- Draw a large birdcage on one piece of cardboard. You are the scientist so make it look like you want. Just make it pretty big.\n- On the other piece of cardboard draw a bird. maybe a Budgie or a Toucan. Just make sure it is smaller than the birdcage.\n- Tape the pictures back-to-back, onto the pencil shaft.\nThe Expected Result:\n- What do you think is going to happen if you spin the pencil? I can't tell you because I did it and this is your discovery.\nThe Experiment:\n- Hold the pencil betweent he palsm of your hands.\n- Rub your hands to make the picture spin around.\n- Of course, you have to look at the picture while it's spinning.\nThe Experiment Result:\n- You should have seen the two pictures appear as one. If you didn't see the bird in the cage, keep trying until you do.\nThat is Science! Have some fun and try different pictures. (I even put Samuel in jail once).\nHey, do you want to do a little magic trick and make a spot on a paper disappear? It's different for each person but it does disappear.\nYes, it's science too but let's get to the experiment and I'll explain the science later.\nIt's simple to set-up. Just draw a square about 1/4 inch to one side of a white piece of paper and color it in. Draw a circle about 3 to 4 inches to the right that's about the same size as the square and color it in. This is the dot you are going to make disappear. Actually you can draw two small pictures, or letters, or numbers, or whatever you want. One of them will disappear.\n- After you draw them hold the paper at arm's length.\n- Closee your left eye and focus on the square with your right eye.\n- Slowly move the paper towards you.\n- At some point the dot will disappear.\n- Try it again and make the square disappear. Close your right eye and focus on the dot with your left eye. Move the paper towards you until the square disappears.\nIt's magic! Well, actually it is science. You see, the spot where your optic nerve connects to your eye doesn't have any photoreceptors. That means it is a blind spot and we all have them.\nYou never noticce this blind spot because your two eyes work together to cover it up. Just like in the first experiment your brain fills in for the blind spot with the background.\nI have a question for you. What do you think will happen if you use a colored piece of paper like red?\nIf you don't know, do another experiment and see for yourself. Science is fun and I am glad I am going to be a scientist. Maybe you'll decide to be one too.\"", "title": "\n"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I must warn you\u2026 this book is ATROCIOUS!\n\n\n\nThe cover has mud all over it, and one of the pages has sprung a leak.\n\n\n\nEven some of the order are in the wrong words.\n\n\n\nIt is the worst of the worst, so don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you\u2026\n\n\n\nOur story begins with an atrocious King, \n\n\n\nNone of his laws ever made any sense.\n\n\n\n\u201cTuesday?\u201d he laughed, \u201cThere is no such day, and I\u2019ll hear no more of it as long as I am king.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom that day on in the kingdom, Monday was followed by second Monday or first Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHis daughter was an atrocious Princess.\n\nShe was not fancy and polite like most princesses, despite the princess lessons she took each day.\n\nShe never brushed her hair. \n\nShe smelled of month- old bananas, and she was very devious.\n\nShe even set traps throughout this story.

GOLDEN\nGemma was only five minutes away from her parents\u2019 hut, but the jungle had already taken on a different personality. It was thicker. The trees had grown taller. The ti plants shaded the green forest a sinister red. There was no doubt about it- the jungle was more dangerous here, and Gemma loved it. As a baby, Gemma\u2019s parents had taken her on their expeditions over mountains, deserts, and vast seas. It was exciting, unpredictable, and deeply irresponsible. Now that they had settled down in the tropical rainforest, Gemma had to devise intricate plans just to sneak out for morning adventures.\n\n\n\n\nThis particular plan hinged on the help of Milo, her ring-tailed lemur. Years of mischief, tom-foolery, and Gemma\u2019s influence had helped Milo develop skills that other lemurs would give theirs rings to have themselves, were such a transaction to be made possible. And on this morning, Milo was lying in Gemma\u2019s bed, wearing a wig made of straw, the same sandy blonde color as Gemma\u2019s hair, snoring loudly. In a stroke of genius, they had even braided it into pigtails to match her style. They tried adding a pair of her old glasses but those kept sliding down his face, given that she had a human-sized head, and his was irreparably lemur-sized.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI swear, her snoring is getting worse and worse,\u201d said Gemma\u2019s dad from the breakfast table, sipping on a warm tea.\n\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom raised an eyebrow from across her book.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even sound human!\u201d he continued.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating a little, don\u2019t you think, dear?\u201d Gemma\u2019s mom said. \n\n\n\n\nBut he was not. And had either of them walked one room over to check on their daughter, they may have shouted, and woken up a little, groggy primate with straw pigtails. \n\n\n\n\nA short walk away, Gemma brushed past a prickly bush and followed a small break in the twisted liana vines. She came to a wall of leaves and grew excited at the sound of movement ahead. She often felt like she could sense when adventure was near. In fact, she felt it almost every single day, and for the past year, she had been wrong roughly every single time. So, despite the eagerness to find something remarkable, her shock was genuine when she brushed the leaves aside. In a small clearing, no larger than a rock pond, was a black jaguar. \n\nShe bravely, confidently, froze.\n\n\n\n\nAs she rubbed the condensation from her glasses, Gemma spotted a small mammal underneath the jaguar\u2019s paw. Further rubbing led to further clarity, and she recognized the animal as a golden mole. Both rare and beautiful. A fear rushed in that, if she didn\u2019t act soon, the mole would be eaten or crushed under the jaguar\u2019s leg.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, Bramblerot!\u201d she whispered.\n\n\n\n\nHalf thinking, half not-at-all-thinking, Gemma reached into the brown satchel at her waist and found a small piece of suede. Wrapped tightly inside was her favorite brass bell. It was a dented, old gift from an even older grandma, and Gemma never left it behind when she ventured out. Normally, she reserved for it occasions that required making a lot of noise, but an emergency like this called for something much more risky.\n\n\n\n\nStepping forward stealthily, Gemma used her other hand to free a thin purple ribbon from her hair, turning her pigtails into a pigtail. She pressed the suede against the bell tightly to make sure that it didn\u2019t attract any unwanted attention. A few paces ahead, and completely unaware of Gemma, the jaguar lifted his paw up for just a moment then pinned the mole down again. Gemma allowed herself a quick and disapproving scowl then focused on the task at hand. She opened the cloth and tied the ribbon around an opening in the brass bell. Then, with the delicacy of a snowflake on a silk napkin at afternoon tea with the Queen, Gemma tied the other end of the ribbon in another knot.\n\n\n\n\nShe slid backwards through the leaves and grabbed the closest suitable rock. As the jaguar leaned down with his teeth bared, Gemma tossed it towards the dense jungle to her left. \n\nWithout a moment to spare, the jaguar lifted his head, and whipped his body around.\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s when he heard a jingle. A strange, suspiciously close, jingle. \n\n\n\n\nHe whipped back the other way and heard the jingle again, but all he saw was jungle. He tried prowling around the clearing, looking for the source, but again saw only jungle. The jingles came faster, one after the other. The mole looked on in surprise as the frustration grew. Then, in the type of overreaction that jaguars are known for, he leapt into the deep brush next to him, looking for anything to attack.\n\n\n\n\nGemma immediately rushed in to grab the wounded golden mole and quickly hid behind the nearest tree. The jaguar ran back into the clearing and looked around with a vicious stare. As soon as he took another step, the bell, which Gemma had fastened securely to his tail, jingled again. Having lost his target, and plagued by the mysterious jingle, the jaguar picked a direction, almost at random, and charged deep into the dark tropical rainforest. When the jingles finally grew quiet, Gemma laid the golden mole down.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s gone,\u201d she said, petting its head softly. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t be sneaking up on anyone for a while,\u201d she added with a smile.\n\n\n\n\nThe mole wheezed out a tiny giggle then shook out its fur. It looked up at Gemma for a long moment, then scrunched its nose. Without a sound, it dug a hole in the soft earth and dove down.\n\n\n\n\nGemma watched in awe as it worked its way out of sight at impressive speed. She peered down to catch one last glimpse, but its little feet had disappeared in a flurry of dirt and dust. Gemma looked around. She had maybe ten minutes before her parents would try to wake her up and then find her missing. It was time to head back. Besides, she had found more than enough adventure for one day. Best for her to leave some for the other young explorers out there. \n\n\n\n\nCarefully listening for the jingle of her favorite bell, Gemma weaved through the thick brush until it loosened and gave way to the path that she had personally made, stomp by stomp, over the better part of a year. She was almost to the hut when a small patch of dirt a few steps ahead of her started to move and shake. Approaching slowly, she leaned down and saw the furry face of the golden mole pop up to greet her. It scurried out of its hole and looked Gemma up and down. Gemma waved hello instinctively, as a matter of manners, and with no idea what else to do.\n\n\n\n\nThe mole reached into the dirt, pulling out an instrument that Gemma had seen many times before. It was a dark blue compass, set on a weathered chain. Gemma grabbed it with two curious hands, turning it over and around to inspect. The compass itself was older than her bell, she imagined, and built with much greater care. Then she reminded herself that her bell was now a jaguar accessory, and no longer hers at all. By the time she was done thinking, the mole had hopped back down its hole, leaving the compass behind. Gemma decided then and there that golden moles were strange creatures with strange habits. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that this was an unfair generalization and would only serve her poorly.\n\n\n\n\nLater that day, Gemma sat at the kitchen table and watched her parents rush around the hut.\n\nThe compass was hanging around her neck, unnoticed. She had never seen them so animated as they gathered their belongings and shouted out questions and commands to each other. It was on this day that they had revealed they\u2019d be going away on a trip of indeterminate length. Without her. Milo looked up at Gemma and cocked his head to the side. She patted her shoulder, the signal that it was okay for him to climb up and sit. Deftly, he swung up her torso and rested. Most times he would wrap only his tail around her neck, but today was different. He hugged her whole head with every limb he had. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cGemma,\u201d said her Mom. \u201cCome and take a walk with me to the waterfall. I have something to tell you.\u201d\n\n2. CROOKED\nFifteen years later, Gemma was standing at the helm of the the Mystic Reed. The sun lit up a bright blue mid-day sky. The saltwater sprayed her glasses with every dip of the bow. After years of sailing the open ocean, she found it refreshing. Milo, being a land mammal in both nature and disposition, found it annoying. He had resigned himself to the squawks of seagulls, the smell of barnacles, and the fact that every single thing on their boat was constantly wet. But, the saltwater stung his nostrils, and that ruffled him the wrong way. He had no choice, though, on such an important mission, but to brave the onslaught from atop Gemma\u2019s shoulder and help with their search. \n\n\n\n\nGemma peered forward over the right side of the boat, which is called the starboard, as her uncle had taught her soon after her parents left. Then she peered over the left side of the boat, which is called the port. She always remembered which was which by reminding herself that \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018port\u2019 have the exact same number of letters. \u2018Starboard\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 have an extraordinarily different number of letters, and therefore were not a part of her memorizing technique. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything, Milo,\u201d she said with a frown, wiping her glasses clean. They were speckled with saltwater again by the time she spoke again. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat sea merchant told us the Forgotten Island would be right here!\u201d she exclaimed. \n\n\n\n\nMilo wrapped his tail around her neck and slid it down to point to the dark blue compass still hanging around her neck, slightly rusted, but otherwise intact. She opened up the cover and tapped the glass. There was a jagged silver needle laying lifeless inside, just as it always did.\n\n\n\n\nGemma looked down and sighed. \u201cYou know that thing doesn\u2019t work. It can\u2019t tell East from West or up from down. I need to remember exactly what that merchant said.\u201d She began to mumble. \u201cAcross the Mossy Channel, due south of Heart Mountain, three days onward\u2026 oh what\u2019s the use!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMilo leapt onto the steering wheel as Gemma walked back to the stern of the boat and looked out across the water. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Forgotten Island for a reason. It\u2019s lost to the world!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHer hand instinctively gripped the railing as the boat shook and shimmied. It slowed to a stop within seconds. She spun her head around to see Milo with his hands and tail in the air. This was often his pose when he wanted to make it clear that what had happened was not his fault. It was almost just as often the case that it was.\n\n\n\n\nGemma looked over the side rail again and saw a dark patch of land that hadn\u2019t been there at last glance. It was a small oval island. They had run aground. \n\n\n\n\nMilo hopped down from the steering wheel and swung over the side of the boat. Gemma\u2019s feet found the wooden rungs on the Jacob\u2019s ladder and stepped down to the thin shoreline. \n\nShe bent and grabbed a handful of sand. It was blue. A deep blue. And dark green as well. Mixed together, it was the exact color of the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRemarkable,\u201d she said, looking around. \u201cThis must be the Forgotten Island, Milo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLess impressed, Milo grabbed a fallen coconut from the ground and started pounding it on a nearby stone. The coconut tree it came from was one of only three trees on the island. The second was a slightly larger coconut tree with equal or better quality and sized coconuts. The third was significantly smaller than the first two, did not grow any coconuts, and was not a coconut tree. Apart from the trees, Gemma spotted a simple hut, with a frond-thatched roof, covered on all sides by vines. Next to it was the entrance to a small cave, handmade from brown stones. \n\n\n\n\nMilo struck a victorious blow, splitting the coconut in two. He drank the water inside greedily then offered Gemma the other half as a snack. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks anyway, Milo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather go check out that hut.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGemma couldn\u2019t help staring into the dark mouth of the cave as she pushed in the hut\u2019s door. It dislodged from the frame in a sloppy commotion and fell to the floor. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Gemma said to no one at all as they stepped on top and entered. She had decided long ago that manners are manners whether someone is there to see them or not. \n\nMilo finished the coconut meat and threw his shell onto the hut floor. He had decided long ago that he was a lemur and, therefore, manners did not apply.  \n\n\n\n\nGemma spotted two windows and tore down the faded green vines covering them. The sunlight burst in to reveal a metal pot, suspended over a compact fire pit. She bent down and held her hands close to the wooden embers.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still warm,\u201d she said with a suspicious tone. \u201cSomeone was here recently.\u201d They looked around to confirm that despite the discovery, they were alone inside the hut. Milo picked his coconut shell up again and placed it on top of his head, just to be safe. Behind the pit there was a small circular table with a dusty chair pulled out. It looked to Gemma as though the seat had been dusted off by a large hand. A quick lap around the room uncovered an empty tin box and a set of clay bowls, but nothing more exciting. Gemma walked to the nearest window and stared out.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShould\u2019ve known that sea merchant was a liar. There\u2019s nothing valuable here. We got hornswoggled, Milo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nMilo looked up at her indignantly.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she conceded, \u201cI got hornswoggled.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThree weeks earlier Gemma sat at a lonely table in the shadows of Starlight Tavern, with Milo by her side. She didn\u2019t enjoy the loud bard music or unruly patrons, but it was the best place in Harbortown to conduct the shady administrative business that came along with treasure hunting. That is to say, it was the only place that allowed the kind of people she needed to meet. Across from her sat one of those very people, known to her only as the sea merchant. He was a handsome mustachioed man with a tricorn hat, and at that moment, he had her rapt attention. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d he said with a smile and a sip of his drink. He had a smooth way of talking that made even the saltiest words come out sweet. Gemma didn\u2019t trust him one bit. She took his words with a grain of regular-colored sand, but she was listening.\n\n\n\n\nMilo stared at the merchant with the fierce protective glare that only a true friend possesses. Unbeknownst to Gemma, it had been two minute since he last blinked. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd how do I know I can trust you?\u201d she asked with an eyebrow raised. \n\n\n\n\nThe sea merchant laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t, friend.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGemma studied his smile. The lines next to his eyes. The piece of corn stuck to his teeth that, had he been a true friend, she would have mentioned to him as a courtesy.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe price. It\u2019s a bit steep,\u201d she replied.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat it is,\u201d said the sea merchant, taking another sip. \u201cBut, this is no ordinary bounty. Through great peril I came to find it. It\u2019s not everyday someone offers you \u2018the most greatest treasure in the world\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s face twisted.\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018The most greatest treasure in the world?\u2019 I\u2019ve heard those words before\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe sea merchant slammed his drink down.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAye, many have heard of it. None have found it.\u201d He leaned in closer. \u201cBut I know the way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGemma gave a coy smirk. \u201cIf you know the way then why don\u2019t you go get it yourself. Surely it\u2019s worth more than you\u2019re asking.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis not in the stars for me, friend. No, I\u2019ll just stay here, safe and sound.\u201d He reached out an open palm. \u201cAnd count my coins.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nShe sighed. It was the best lead she had gotten in months and, despite her concerns, she couldn\u2019t turn it down. Besides, she was desperate for adventure, and if what the merchant said was even half true, it would be the stuff of legends. \n\n\n\n\nGemma looked to Milo and gave a nod. Without breaking his stare, Milo used his tail to lift up a pouch of coins and drop it on the table. Milo was the only lemur Gemma had ever met who had a prehensile tail, capable of gripping things, and it never ceased to amaze her. The sea merchant snatched the pouch up before the sound even hit Gemma\u2019s ears. He took off his hat, leaned in close to cover the sides of their faces from a busy tavern, and whispered the instructions. The first rivers and channels and landmarks he mentioned were familiar, but the rest were completely foreign to her. She listened more carefully than she ever had before, repeating the words back to herself. \n\n\n\n\nWhen he was finished, Gemma turned to Milo and gave another quick nod.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I guess that all we need to know,\u201d she said, turning back to the sea merchant. \u201cThanks for\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBut the sea merchant was nowhere to be seen. Only his hat remained. Gemma and Milo were genuinely impressed by the mystique of it for a few seconds. Until they heard, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d from underneath the table. The sea merchant\u2019s hand reached up and grabbed the hat, since it was a high-quality hat, and not the kind you would leave behind for the sake of mystique.\n\n\n\n\nBack inside the hut, Gemma looked out the window and sighed. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI guess there were some red flags,\u201d she said. Her eyes settled on the rock cave outside. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cCome on, Milo. We might as well check every nook and cranny,\u201d she said with a shrug.\n\n\n\n\nMilo squeaked as they stomped over the fallen door.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA cranny. It\u2019s basically the same thing as a nook,\u201d she responded.\n\n\n\n\nAs Gemma and Milo walked inside the cave they carried some of the island\u2019s blue sand with them. The entrance sloped down on a path of dark brown dirt that went on longer than either of them expected. When they reached the interior, the mid-day sun was almost completely blocked. Gemma felt around the cold walls and found a sconce holding a torch.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMilo, flint me,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\n\nMilo reached inside the small pouch at his side and pulled out a flint stone, used for sparking flames. Swiftly, he tossed it past her open hand and hit her in the forehead. They had gotten good at starting cozy fires, but hadn\u2019t yet perfected the handoff. In a dark cave and without any practice throws, they had almost no chance. \n\n\n\n\nGemma lit the torch and uncovered a cave of deep red stone. The flame created shadows that danced over the nooks in the side of the cave. They danced over crannies as well which, it\u2019s worth noting, are actually an entirely different thing than nooks. What drew both of their attention, as soon as they saw it, was a wooden chest in the center. As they walked forward, its gold trim and lock shimmered in the light. \n\n\n\n\nWith each approaching step, Gemma noticed a peculiar thing start to happen. From around her neck, the compass began to shake. She stopped to raise it over her head and open the top. The jagged silver needle was vibrating loudly. Testing a theory, she took a step forward and the rattle increased until it filled the room.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s never done this before,\u201d she said. Milo looked up at her with wide yellow eyes. \u201cWhy would it shake now? It doesn\u2019t even work.\u201d Gemma carefully opened up the glass cover and grasped the needle to stop the shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s not a compass at all\u2026\u201d She lifted her hand up and, to her surprise, removed the needle with ease. \n\n\n\n\nMilo scuttled over to the lock and examined it. Excitedly, he jumped up and down. Gemma felt as though she understood what he meant. Through years of being best friends, they had developed their own kind of language, and she was rarely wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou want me to bake you a muffin, Milo?\u201d Rarely wrong, but sometimes. \n\n\n\n\nMilo scoffed and pointed at the lock. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cOhhhh, use the needle on the lock,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, it looked a whole lot like your muffin dance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGemma bent down and lined the needle up to the keyhole to find it was roughly the same size. With the torch in one hand, flickering wildly around the cave, she pressed the twisted needle into the lock.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHere goes something,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\n\n\nSlowly, she turned the needle until she felt a click. The top to the chest popped open with ease. Gemma tapped her shoulder and Milo climbed up to see. She raised the torch and stared down. Inside, she saw her own face and Milo\u2019s, distorted by a blanket of ripples. It was water. Dark ancient, water. And in the center, floating with a calmness, was a tiny boat. \n\n\n\n\nGemma had less than a moment to study it before she heard a familiar sound. One she had not heard for many years. It was the jingle of her old favorite bell. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, Bramblerot,\u201d she said. \n\n3. FREED\nSomewhere inside the cave, the jingle came again. Gemma turned to see a shadowy four-legged figure growing larger. The steps were slow and deliberate. Each one was punctuated by the dragging roll of a bell along the dirt floor, swaying gracefully from a ribbon. When he came into to the light, Gemma cringed. His face had never left her, never lost its sharpness in her dreams. Milo silently slunk behind the chest, out of sight, and Gemma was thankful at least for that. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of him being the appetizer to a Gemma-sized main course. With nothing to lose and no better ideas in her petrified mind, she spoke.\n\n\n\n\u201cHi there,\u201d she pushed out. \u201cI\u2026 I like your ribbon. I used to have one just like it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe jaguar paused to rest on his back legs and stare. Examining her face, his slim eyes opened a touch. Gemma smiled nervously. It was then, no sooner or later than Gemma\u2019s teeth cleared her lips, that the jaguar attacked. \n\n\n\nAs he sprung towards her, he let out a growl more spine-shaking than Gemma had ever heard. They say that the fervor of a domesticated pet or long-caged beast is nothing when compared to the fierceness of a creature in the wild. Had you asked Gemma in that moment, she would certainly have agreed, and even more certainly would have wanted to discuss at a time when she was not the target of a jaguar pounce. \n\n\n\nAs luck would have it, the jaguar would never reach her. Just inches from Gemma\u2019s face, which was scrunched up and bracing for impact, the jaguar was stopped. Sneaking in the shadows of the cave, Milo had made it to the other side just in time to reach out and grab the jaguar\u2019s tail. But, a fuzzy tail is tough to hold onto, even for an experienced tail-grabber like Milo, and his grip slid all the way down to the dangling bell. The purple ribbon stretched and strained from the tension. Gemma grabbed the small ship from inside the chest and ducked away towards Milo, just as the bell and ribbon snapped off of the jaguar\u2019s tail. The bell fell to the dusty ground with a jingle, but Milo clutched the ribbon in his hand. The jaguar\u2019s momentum caused him to fly forward and slam into the open lid of the chest, then down into the water with a splash. Gemma looked back briefly to see the lid fall down over his head. \n\n\n\nThey rushed out onto the miniature beach and headed straight for the Mystic Reed. Gemma looked down at Milo and got the nod she needed. She handed him the tiny ship, then picked Milo up and swung him over the boat\u2019s rail. This move had been mastered well beyond the flint toss, as hasty escapes were commonplace for a pair of treasure hunters like them. Milo instinctively let out the sail for the reverse wind to push them off the shore. Gemma took two steps up the Jacob\u2019s ladder and held on as the boat cleared the shallows. \n\n\n\nThe jaguar raced out of the cave, sopping wet, straight towards them, but came to a stop at the frothy shoreline. All he could do was sit on the blue sand and snarl and growl at the receding boat. Now that Gemma and Milo were both safely on board and protected by the waves between them, they found the jaguar slightly less intimidating than moments ago. Milo handed Gemma her purple ribbon, then steered the boat into the open ocean. Gemma tied the ribbon back into her hair and shouted off the stern in the back of the boat.\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry we snagged your tail and shot you into a chest of water! And sorry for taking the tiny ship you were guarding! And\u2026\u201d Gemma turned back to Milo. \u201cThis is weirdest apology I\u2019ve ever given.\u201d Milo nodded and banked the wheel to his left. \u201cWe\u2019re just sorry!\u201d finished Gemma. \n\n\n\nShe took over command of the wheel and set off in the direction where the sky looked clearest. The Forgotten Island faded from view as swiftly as it had appeared, almost like magic. Milo sprawled out on the deck with the tiny ship and began examining it. He tapped it on the side, wiggled the rudder in back, and held it up from every angle. \n\n\n\n\u201cFind anything interesting?\u201d Gemma called out.\n\n\n\nMilo shook his head with a sigh and placed the ship onto the wooden deck. Then, a playful smirk crept up as he decided to spin it around like a dreidel. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hardly call that \u2018the most greatest treasure in the world\u2019! There must be more to it,\u201d she continued to herself. \u201c\u2018Most greatest treasure.\u2019 Who talks like that? It\u2019s something a kid would say.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe glint from the bow of another boat stole her attention. Somehow, it had come within four lengths of the Mystic Reed without her noticing, and was now pulling alongside them.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got company Milo!\u201d she shouted. But Milo\u2019s attention had been stolen too, not by the life-sized boat pulling ever closer, but by the tiny ship in his hands. Spinning it had betrayed an exciting secret. Something hidden was rattling around inside. \n\n\n\nThe Mystic Reed slowed to a stop as the strange, unknown boat settled by its side. A six-foot-tall man with dark curly hair and a long nose stepped away from his helm towards Gemma.\n\n\n\n\u201cAhoy!\u201d he said over the railing of his old, wonky boat. It was filled with so many knick-knacks and trinkets that it looked like a giant had picked up a dozen different shops and shaken their contents on board.\n\n\n\n\u201cAhoy,\u201d Gemma said back. \n\n\n\n\u201cPleasure to meet you. Might I ask your name and the name of this fine vessel?\u201d said the man.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Gemma, and this is the Mystic Reed. My friend\u2019s name is Milo but he\u2019s a bit busy at the moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo pulled off the crow\u2019s nest on top of the tiny ship and peeked inside the hollow mast. His eyes grew two sizes when he spotted a scroll that had been rolled up and tucked away. Using his lemur fingers, he clawed at it, tongue sticking out in concentration. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d she asked back.\n\n\n\nThe man proudly stepped aside to show the full span of his boat. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis here is the Dusty Rust Busket,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\n\n\nGemma looked confused. \u201cDo you mean Dusty Rust Bucket?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBucket? This isn\u2019t a bucket- it\u2019s a boat!\u201d he snapped back. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Gemma, \u201cI just thought\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo pulled the scroll from the ship and let out a sequel of delight. Finally taking notice of the stranger,  the Dusty Rust Busket, and his general surroundings, he hid it behind his back and joined Gemma. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou thought wrong,\u201d added the man, still stinging from the question. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again, um\u2026\u201d Gemma replied with curiosity.\n\n\n\n\u201cCharles. My name is Charles Bucket. But you can call me Chuck,\u201d he said with a grand bow. \n\n\n\nGemma tapped her shoulder and Milo hopped up. \u201cMilo, I\u2019d like you to meet Chuck Bucket of the Dusty Rust Busket.\u201d As yet, it was the silliest sentence she had ever said aloud, but she still had many sentences and much silliness ahead of her. \n\n\n\nChuck Bucket gave a less exaggerated bow and half smile to Milo. \n\n\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve all been introduced, might we discuss the riddle in your lemur\u2019s hand?\u201d he asked. \n\n4. SERPENTINE\nGemma hadn\u2019t noticed. It wasn\u2019t until Milo hiccuped at the question, as he sometimes does when he\u2019s surprised, that she realized he was holding something behind his back. He shot her a sheepish stare, which is hard for a lemur to do. Slowly, he pulled out the thin scroll from behind his back. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you get that, Milo?\u201d Gemma asked with surprise, but no hiccups.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe it was from that little toy he was playing with over there,\u201d interrupted Chuck, pointing to the tiny ship on the deck of the Mystic Reed. \n\n\n\nMilo offered it up to Gemma. She grabbed it and shot him a stare. There was no room for secrets on a boat. That\u2019s something that he Uncle Horace had taught her. The Mystic Reed was her boat, and she didn\u2019t like the idea of a stranger knowing more about its goings-on than her.\n\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it yet, Captain Bucket,\u201d she said, turning back to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what makes you think it\u2019s a riddle\u2026\u201d Gemma unrolled the scroll and scanned the parchment. She paused, then looked up again. \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, fine, it\u2019s a riddle.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore curious than the hidden riddle was the way in which it was written. The beautiful black-ink calligraphy had a quality that she had seen only twice while sailing the Eight Seas. The first time was in a ledger, stolen off a royal ship, that she had won in a game of checkers. Milo lost it in a different game of checkers the same night. The second was on a spyglass telescope that Gemma\u2019s uncle had shown her. \u201cA gift from old friends,\u201d he had said.\n\nThis writing was just as intricate and written with even more care. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow did you know what was on here?\u201d asked Gemma.\n\n\n\nChuck Bucket gave his biggest, kindness smile. \u201cI know a riddle when I see one. I deal with them quite a bit in my travels.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma pondered this for a moment. She had known some treasure hunters that traded riddles late into the night on a long journey. They did it for entertainment, but also to test their wits. A few of the riddles were ancient and well-known. The kind of riddles that some children could answer proudly. But, sometimes a sailor would come from a distant land with a riddle that was yet untold. Gemma liked the idea that the world still held secret riddles waiting to be solved, and suspected that Captain Chuck Bucket had uncovered a great many in his work.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s have it,\u201d he added. He leaned in close and stuck his ear out towards her. \n\n\n\nGemma read the scroll aloud.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a small pond, I was a small fish.\n\nNow is the time, to grant me my wish.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe read it aloud a second time to be sure. Gemma and Milo looked at each other with blank stares. \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, Milo,\u201d said Gemma. \u201cWas there a fish in the ship?\u201d Milo crossed his arms and shook his head. He was not a fish thief.\n\n\n\nCaptain Chuck Bucket sighed and stood up straight again. \u201cI had hoped it might be more difficult. I do enjoy a difficult riddle.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou mean you know what the answer?\u201d Gemma asked with surprise.\n\n\u201cIndeed I do,\u201d he replied. \n\n\n\nThere was a great pause. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 will you tell us?!\u201d spit it out Gemma. \n\n\n\nCaptain Bucket stroked his chin and thought for a moment. \u201cI might,\u201d he said. \u201cI might.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo lifted his finger in the air excitedly then hopped down to rummage below deck. He came scurrying back up on two legs holding a checkers board. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, Milo!\u201d urged Gemma. \u201cYou are not playing him in checkers for it. You\u2019ll end up losing the boat.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo pouted and turned back around.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never won,\u201d whispered Gemma to Captain Bucket. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean that as an exaggeration. I mean not a single time. And he played a chicken, twice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBad luck I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Captain Bucket sweetly. Then his eyes lit up, as if an idea had just struck him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we trade instead! You give me that elegant purple ribbon in your hair, and I\u2019ll give you the answer. It will add nicely to my collection,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nGemma touched the ribbon in her hair. \u201cMy ribbon?\u201d she questioned, undoing the knot and holding it in her hands. \u201cI suppose. I just got it back, though.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t miss it much.\u201d Captain Bucket reached out and grabbed it from her hands, then secured it in his own, wavy hair. \n\n\n\nHe retreated to the steering wheel of the Dusty Rust Busket and waved Gemma farewell.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye Gemma! A chance encounter I won\u2019t soon forget!\u201d he said, pulling away.\n\n\n\nMilo arrived back and sat on the railing, looking out. \n\n\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d shouted Gemma. \u201cWhat\u2019s the answer to the riddle!\u201d\n\n\n\nCaptain Bucket gave one last smile and cupped his hands to his mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes what we just need room to explore. That ship you found is looking for a bigger pond!\u201d And with that, he spun The Dusty Rust Busket towards the horizon and sailed away.\n\n\n\nGemma stood watching for a moment longer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe make deals with some interesting people, Milo,\u201d she said to a nod. \n\n\n\nMilo picked up the tiny ship and handed it to Gemma. It was hardly the straightforward answer that Gemma had wanted, but it was still a step in the right direction. The tiny ship needed more room. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt needs a bigger pond.\u201d The pair peered over the edge of the boat into the water and watched low waves slap the hull. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much bigger than that,\u201d she said. It was the best, and only, idea that she had. Gemma took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and dropped the tiny ship over the edge of the Mystic Reed. \u201cI sure hope it floats,\u201d she added. \n\n\n\nThe ship plopped down below the surface, sending out ripples, then bobbed back up. A small cylinder in the back of the boat, that Milo had assumed was a miniature barrel, became electrified by the salt water ocean. It whirred and wizzed until a propellor protruded out of the end. It turned slowly at first, and then built up steam, until it was spinning so fast that the blades couldn\u2019t be seen. With a gentle hum, the tiny ship sped off in a direction only it knew. \n\n\n\n\u201cMilo! That ship is getting away!\u201d Gemma jumped back to the steering wheel. Using all of her might, she grabbed a peg on the wheel and pulled hard to spin the boat around. Milo wrapped his tail and hands around another one and pulled alongside her. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she shouted.\n\n\n\nThe boat had turned almost all the way around by the time they were on course to follow. Milo climbed up the mast and used their spyglass telescope to spot the tiny ship. Whenever Gemma veered too far in one direction Milo would squeak and point to the starboard or port. The Mystic Reed had a great size advantage over the tiny ship that it was tailing, however a sailboat is at whim of the wind, and must, at times, take a more indirect route to get where it\u2019s going. So, it was with both luck and skill that Gemma and her first mate, or \u2018first primate\u2019 as she liked to joke, caught up to the ship in time to see it find the lightning current.\n\n\n\nGemma had heard tales of a current of electric blue, so powerful and full of life that it lit up the surface of the sea, but she had never seen it. She didn\u2019t truly believe anyone else had either. But as they approached the tiny ship, there was no denying that it was riding down the center of a glowing blue stream the very shape and color of lightning. The tiny ship zigged and zagged with the turns, and Gemma did her best to stay the course. She no longer needed Milo\u2019s navigation, since the sea itself was showing her the way. The lighting pattern got slimmer and slimmer as the two vessels approached a sandy shore. \n\n\n\nThe tiny ship stopped dead just before the break of the waves on the shore. Gemma dropped anchor and watched from above as it let out a few bubbles and flipped over. The hull opened up just before the ship sank out of sight. In its place, it left a message in a bottle floating on the water, waiting to be opened.\n\n \n\n5. SANDY\nGemma and Milo sat around a campfire on the shore at dusk. They had found nothing but dunes, which are small hills of sand, and desert, and Gemma decided it was best for them to stay near the Mystic Reed for the night. The biggest reason was that there was no way to tell where the tiny ship had led them. Nearest Gemma could figure, the Forbidden Island had been somewhere on the edge of the Azul Sea, and its waters were, by far, the most mysterious of the Eight Seas. Almost all of her treasure hunting was done in the Cascade Sea and the Sparkling Sea. Occasionally, she ventured to out the Mosaic Sea to island hop, but that was more for Milo than for riches. Gemma always found a reason to stop by Lemur Island while they were there, to Milo\u2019s utter delight. The Azul Sea, though, had a reputation for legend and danger. There were even rumblings of fantastical creatures but, Gemma noted, never any evidence or firsthand accounts. Once they found whatever it was they were looking for, Gemma vowed to sail them straight back home to Harbortown. But first, they would need to decipher another riddle. This time it had come from a bottle.\n\n\n\nGemma held the empty bottle in her hand and read the clue on the piece of paper aloud once again.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the day rises, the cottontails run.\n\nFollow their tracks by the light of the sun.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe fire crackled as Gemma and Milo pondered the words. \n\n\n\n\u201cCottontails. They must mean rabbits right?\u201d Milo curled his tail into a tight ball and hopped around on all fours. \n\n\n\n\u201cQuit it Milo, this is serious business,\u201d Gemma said with a laugh and a smile.\n\n\n\nMilo grabbed a bundle of licorice and snapped off a piece that he felt he\u2019d earned for his performance. Gemma had laid out some food around the campfire, that she got from the yellow knapsack that she always brought on expeditions. There was sourdough bread, jerky, apples, oranges, and a bundle of licorice that was getting smaller by the hour.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever we\u2019re supposed to do next, it has to wait for morning. \u2018By the light of the sun\u2019 the riddle says.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma pulled out a deck of purple Giants and Goblins cards. They were a gift from her uncle soon after her parents sent her to stay with him. \u201cThey\u2019re good for passing the time on the sea,\u201d he would say. \u201cRemember, the Giants might be stronger, but Goblins have the numbers and the smarts.\u201d Her uncle had taught her all the best combinations and tricks. His shipmates taught her all the best ways to cheat. Cheating was as big of a part of the game as anything else; even more so when Milo was playing. They played game after game, until the stars were glowing as brightly as the lightning bugs nearby.\n\n\n\n\u201cI play a Stone Giant!\u201d said Gemma triumphantly.\n\n\n\nMilo looked at his deck with his tongue slightly sticking out of his mouth, a sign of his highest level of concentration. He gave a sly wheezing chuckle and laid down four Goblins, three that had weapons and one that was holding a lyre, a musical instrument. He raised his hands and shook them together triumphantly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWait, a second, let me see your tail!\u201d she demanded. Milo spun around but conveniently kept his tail hidden from view. But Gemma stood up and spotted the four clandestine cards he was gripping behind his back. \n\n\n\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a Goblin thief!\u201d \n\n\n\nMilo looked back up at her with the widest, most innocent yellow eyes he could muster, until a smile swept over Gemma\u2019s face involuntarily. Soon they were laughing. \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I bother playing with you,\u201d she realized. \n\n\n\nMilo stood up proudly and let out a series of serious and determined squeaks. \n\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know. You come from a long line of cheaters and it was your great grandlemur\u2019s last wish that you carry on the tradition,\u201d Gemma translated. It was, in fact, exactly what Milo was saying. \n\n\n\nGemma laid back onto a piece of driftwood and looked up at the moon, full in the sky. She tapped her side and Milo nodded to accept, snuggling in next to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is, Milo? What\u2019s the \u2018most greatest treasure in the world\u2019?\n\n\n\nMilo thought for a moment then hopped up with a smile. He pointed to his tail with both hands and squeaked. Gemma smirked and then laid back down dismissively.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is NOT a gold tail ringlet. Not everyone has a tail you know.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo shrugged and laid back down. Gemma didn\u2019t say it, but there was more than one occasion when she had truly, desperately wished she had a tail. It was hard to have a best friend with Milo\u2019s tail talents. It was a constant reminder that her rear end was inferior in all but one way: sitting in chairs. Milo had a difficult time finding a place for his tail. If a genie gave her the chance to grow one she would have taken it. Although, it would have meant finding a genie with a very specific set of powers. And then it would mean a lot of explaining, being a human with a lemur-sized tail for the rest of her life. These were the thoughts that carried Gemma off to sleep that night: a tail-obsessed genie, and a lifetime of arguments with pants-makers. \n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the sun or Milo\u2019s snoring that woke Gemma up, but the low trampling rumble of a stampede. The vibrations rocked her awake and caused her eyes to open through heavy blinks. A cloud of sand was approaching their camp.\n\n\n\n\u201cWake up, Milo! It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a\u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is!\u201d Gemma yelled. \n\n\n\nMilo sat upright and rubbed his eyes. A piece of licorice still hung from his lips as he looked around. He was just in time to see a blur of ears and feet and tails storming into the center of their campsite. They were moving in a speedy, rigid formation. A hard and sharp turn towards the desert led them straight over the sand dunes, out of sight. There was no mistaking it, these were cottontail rabbits, just as Gemma had expected. But she had not expected what they found in the rabbits\u2019 wake. Milo stuffed the dangling licorice into his mouth as they stared at the bare ground, with not a speck of food left. \n\n6. SPICED \n\u201cAfter them!\u201d yelled Gemma. The pack of cottontail rabbits had cleared the beach and hurried into the desert. Milo grabbed the sack off the sandy shore and handed it to Gemma. They followed after the rabbits, kicking up swirls of sand like a tornado in a field of flowers. \n\n\n\nRunning with all the speed they could muster, Gemma and Milo kept up for the better part of an hour. Under the blistering sun, it was getting harder and harder to keep up their pace. The rabbits, it seemed, were a bit more adept than them at desert sprints, whether they wanted to admit it or not. As the sun hit the middle of the sky, the chase brought them all to a small desert oasis, with palm trees, green plants, and a small fresh water pond. \n\n\n\n\u201cAm I seeing things, Milo?\u201d asked Gemma, out of breath and so hot that her hair seemed to be sweating. Milo\u2019s wide eyes and drooling grin told her that she wasn\u2019t. \u201cNo time to stop,\u201d she panted, \u201cWe need to catch those rabbits.\u201d Milo let out a disappointed squeak, but pressed on.\n\n\n\nThe rabbits tore through the oasis without a second thought and continued onto large dunes. When Gemma and Milo took the same path and came to the top of a dune, the rabbits were gone. All they saw were row upon row of sand dunes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey could\u2019ve gone anywhere,\u201d said Gemma. \u201cThose dunes make it impossible to see!\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo raised his finger to make a point and then flopped back on to the sand. \n\n\n\n\u201cMilo! Are you okay?\u201d she asked. Milo didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to go to the oasis?\u201d she asked. Milo didn\u2019t move. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want me to carry you to the oasis?\u201d she asked. Milo lifted his head and nodded with a smile. \n\n\n\nGemma picked him up and they made their way back down the dune, straight towards the oasis pond. The shade from the palm trees gave them immediate relief from the sun overhead as they laid down by the pond next to each other. There were a dozen bushes and patches of uneven grass around the rim of the water. It felt cool and soft beneath their heads. It was the first moment of rest they\u2019d had since waking up, and it felt better than good and gooder than great to not be running.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow are we going to catch those rabbits?\u201d Gemma asked. Instead of answering, Milo rolled over into the pond and slurped up as much water as he could. \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess we can figure it out tomorrow,\u201d she said. But, Milo didn\u2019t hear her, because he was busy doing the backstroke. \n\n\n\nThat night, under a sky filled with stars, they sat around a new fire and got ready for sleep. The water had rejuvenated them, but their food supply was dwindling, after the rambunctious rabbits had robbed them. This night\u2019s feast was smaller than the last, but they were happy to have it. As Milo chewed on a licorice stick, Gemma laid her head on a particularly comfortable patch of onion grass. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo, what do you really think the most greatest treasure in the world will be?\u201d she asked him. \n\n\n\nMilo hopped up and twirled his fingers around his tail from top to bottom with a series of squeaks. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a diamond tail spiral, Milo. Not everything has to do with your tail!\u201d she replied. \n\n\n\nMilo chuckled to himself and laid down next to her. They stared up at the night sky and got lost in the sparkling patterns above them. \n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said. Milo nodded happily. They remind me of the night before my parents left. My mom took me to a waterfall and\u2026\u201d Gemma was interrupted by Milo\u2019s snoring. She glanced over and saw him, fast asleep. \u201cGoodnight, Milo,\u201d she finished. \n\n\n\nThe next morning, they were woken again by the herd of cottontails. Exhausted from a day of pursuit, Gemma and Milo had slept all the way through to mid-day. The rabbits headed straight through the oasis, as they had before. By the time Gemma opened her eyes and realized it, it was too late. Gemma had left their food out again, and the rabbits were devouring it as they passed. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo! Shoo! Get outta here!\u201d she yelled, sitting up and reaching towards them. They were gone before she got to her feet. \n\n\n\nGemma grabbed her bag and ran to the top of the dune. Just like before, the rabbits were gone. More gone even. It had taken Gemma longer to climb the dune, in her sleepy state. Milo, had, impressively, not even woken up. \n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone again,\u201d she said, as Milo rubbed his eyes open. \u201cAnd they took the food we left out.\u201d Milo scrambled to the backpack and crawled inside to look through. He came back out with a frown. \n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we have left is some bread, four licorice sticks, a coconut, and those spices that make you\u2026\u201d Gemma stopped. \n\n\n\n\u201cMilo, I think I have an idea. Tomorrow, when they come back. You and I are going to be ready,\u201d she said with a grin. Milo grinned too, not because he knew the plan but because he liked when Gemma grinned. \n\n\n\nUnder the moonlight on the third night, Gemma and Milo laid down to sleep. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to rest up if my plan is going to work,\u201d she said, fixing her pillow of onion grass. \n\n \n\nMilo snuggled up to a soft bush and got cozy. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo, one last try. What do you think the \u2018most greatest treasure in the world\u2019 is?\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo hopped up even more excited than before. He swung his tail around like a lasso, hopped on both feet, pointed to the sky, then back at his tail, wrapped it around his leg, then danced a jig. \n\n\n\n\u201cMilo! That\u2019s\u2026 actually, okay that would be pretty amazing.\u201d \n\n\n\nMilo laid down and fell asleep with a smile on his face.\n\n\n\nWhen mid-day came, Gemma and Milo had packed their bag, drank lots of water, and were waiting in the center of the oasis. Bits and chunks of bread were spread out on the ground in front of them.\n\n\n\nThe cottontail rabbits came over the horizon and headed right for their camp. \n\n\n\n\u201cHere we go, Milo. I hope this works.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rabbits ran over their camp just as they had each day before. And they ate all the food, just as they had the each day before. When they headed up the dune, with Gemma and Milo chasing them, there was not a speck of bread left. \n\n\n\nAt the top of the dune, Gemma looked around and, once again, saw only sand. Milo looked to her, but she held up her hand. They stood, waiting. Nothing happened. \n\n\n\n\u201cCome on\u2026 come on\u2026\u201d she whispered. \n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s when a puff of sand shot up on the other side of a dune to their left. And then another.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d she said, pointing. They ran off in the direction of the sand puffs. As they came to the top of the next dune, they looked around again. Another puff from a different dune. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d yelled Gemma. The spices on that bread are making them sneeze, just like you, Milo!\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma and Milo ran up and down dunes all afternoon, never losing track of the rabbits and their sandy sneezes. Then, to their surprise, the puffs of sand stopped moving. They all came from the same place, on the other side of a tall dune. When Gemma and Milo reached the top, they looked down over a group of sleeping, sneezing, cottontail rabbits, curled up together. They were lying at the foot of a dirt path that stretched through a few trees, then on into a deep, dark forest. \n\n7. STARRY\nYoung Gemma and her mom had stopped at the foot of a waterfall. The moonlight hit the water and made it glow a silvery blue as it rolled over the rocks and down to the stream below. Gemma thought of how this might be last time that she saw the night sky over the rainforest with her mom. It made her love the flickering stars even more. And for a reason she couldn\u2019t completely understand, it made her angry at each and every one. She stood across the stream from her mother and looked up. Both of her parents were taller than her but her mother was not nearly as out of reach as her father. Gemma imagined that she was only a few years of eating vegetables away from drawing even. \n\n\n\n\u201cGemma, do you know why your father and I are explorers?\u201d asked her mom.\n\n\n\nThe answer was so simple to Gemma that she was almost confused. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of it,\u201d said Gemma\u2019s mom with a smile. \u201cBut far from all of it.\u201d \n\n\n\nHer mom leaned down close to the stream and reached in with both hands. She scooped up an impressive amount of water. A few more years of drinking milk and Gemma\u2019s hands would be just as large, she was sure. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you see in my hands, Gemma?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\nGemma was confused again. These were hardly questions worthy of a waterfall chat. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s water,\u201d she said confidently. \n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom spread her fingers and let the water slip down like the waterfall. A layer of mud covered her hands. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mud,\u201d answered Gemma. \n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom sifted through the mud, until glimmers of gold rose to the surface. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s eyes sparkled as she looked at the precious metal in her mom\u2019s hand. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou see. There is wonder all us around us,\u201d explained her mother. She pointed to the water. \u201cIn the sea.\u201d She slapped the mud into Gemma\u2019s hands, making her laugh. \u201cIn the earth.\u201d\n\nGemma\u2019s mom looked up. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd in the sky!\u201d interrupted Gemma. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said her mom. \n\n\n\nGemma looked up. Her eyes still sparkling, until she remembered. \u201cBut, why do you have to go?\u201d she asked. She could feel the tears coming whether she wanted them or not. \n\n\n\nThen it was her mom\u2019s turn to get serious.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the beginning, it has been the job of explorers to find the wonders of this world. And to keep them safe,\u201d she explained. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd to keep them secret?\u201d asked Gemma.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely!\u201d replied her mom. \u201cWe are a group. We work together to protect these wonders. But there is one of us who would take them. Who would use them for their own gain.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s face scrunched up in anger. She understood that it was wrong for someone to take things that weren\u2019t theirs. But more than that, she understood that her mother and father were leaving because of whoever this person was.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho is it??\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019ll stop them!\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom reached out and grabbed her hand with a smile. \u201cI have no doubt you would. But it is a job for your father and I. There are things you still don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d demanded Gemma. There were few things that Gemma disliked more than not knowing things that she wanted to know. It ranked just below not having things that she wanted to have.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a key,\u201d her mom relented. \n\n\n\n\u201cLike a key to open something?\u201d asked Gemma. \n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered her mom. \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t know what it looks like. It was here, underground, and they came for it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was a lot for Gemma to understand. \u201cThey came to the jungle?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes. But, don\u2019t worry, they have no interest in us, they were just looking for the key.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd they took it?\u201d asked Gemma. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems that the key is still hidden, but we don\u2019t know where. We must find it before anyone else does, Gemma.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Gemma. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom found her favorite constellation in the sky and let out a sigh. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe stuff of dreams, Gemma. The stuff of dreams.\u201d\n\n 8. WOODED\nThe cottontail rabbits were fast asleep as Gemma and Milo snuck by. There was no use in waking them. The path lay ahead, and besides, the rabbits were too good at stealing food to give them another chance at the knapsack. At first, the path was covered in a tan dirt and surrounded by low bushes with just a few leaves. As the day turned to dusk, the path became dark, surrounded by trees. It wasn\u2019t long before they passed through an archway of green branches, made many years before. Gemma and Milo stepped forward into the deep woods. They were entering what was known to the ancestors of old as the Forrest of Misfortune.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a good feeling about this place, Milo,\u201d said Gemma.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that she did not know that this was the forrest\u2019s name. \n\n\n\nAs dusk continued into night, Gemma and Milo found the path more and more overgrown with branches. A strange orange bird looked down on them from a tall tree. Milo looked up and stared at it suspiciously. He kept his eyes on it as he walked. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bird, Milo,\u201d said Gemma, looking back. \u201cJust because these plants and animals are new to us doesn\u2019t make them bad.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma pushed ahead. The moment she turned her back, the bird glared at Milo and stuck out its tongue. Before Milo could make a fuss, Gemma urged him on.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019ve got to find something soon before it gets too dark.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo rushed to catch up, and ran right into Gemma from behind. She had stopped dead at a wall of multi-colored leaves. Slowly, she parted them to see that the path went into a circular clearing, and stopped at a lonely tree in the center. This was no ordinary tree, however. It was large. And not large in the way that the largest apple is when surrounded by smaller apples. It was large in the way that a watermelon is when surrounded by grapes. There was grass all around it and the roots were covered with moss and, for some reason, it had an orange glow. It was the most impressive tree that Gemma had ever seen. \n\n\n\n\u201cI think this is what we were supposed to find, Milo,\u201d said Gemma, never breaking her stare. Milo nodded. \n\n\n\nIt was so impressive in fact, that Gemma didn\u2019t notice the two doors at its base until she was a few feet away. They were made from a different wood than the tree itself. One was painted blue, and the other was painted not blue. It is not remembered what color the second door was painted, so it cannot be said for sure what it was, except that it was not blue. Gemma approached the blue door. There was no one else around and there were no signs to be read.\n\n\n\n\u201cI guess we should just try both of them,\u201d guessed Gemma.\n\n\n\nBut before her hand could turn the brass knob, a small window opened up above their heads. It was impossible to see it until it opened since it was made form the same wood as the tree, and its seams were seamless. \n\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said a voice from the window. A small elderly woman with pink pigtails poked her head out from above and peered down. \n\n\n\nGemma pulled her hand back and stood up straight. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh, um, why is that?\u201d she asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cBecause only one of those doors will lead you up to me. The other will suck you inside and spit you out on the other side of the world,\u201d said the woman. \n\n\n\nMilo laughed dismissively and slapped his leg. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d said the woman. \u201cGive it a try, then. I should mention that the other side of the world is smack dab in the middle of the Durg Sea.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo laughed a little softer. Then not at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would someone design a tree like that?!\u201d protested Gemma.\n\n\n\nThe elderly woman cocked her head. The pigtails on her head bobbed. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for something extraordinary, my dear,\u201d she said. \u201cExtraordinary is not easy.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma and Milo looked at each other excitedly. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou know what we\u2019re looking for?\u201d she asked the woman with pink pigtails. \u201cAll we know is that it\u2019s the most greatest treasure in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand why they started calling it that. It\u2019s something a child would say.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman started down at them, then retreated back into the tree and shut the window abruptly.\n\n\n\nGemma was startled. \u201cBut\u2026 hey!\u201d she shouted.\n\n\n\nThe woman stuck her head out again and looked down. \u201cAh, you two\u2026 yes, what is it?\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma pleaded with her. \u201cExcuse me, miss\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Willow,\u201d she responded.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat a beautiful name, were you named after this tree?\u201d Gemma asked with a smile slightly too big for her mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow should I know?\u201d said Willow with a scoff. \u201cI was a baby at the time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRight\u2026 well, I\u2019m Gemma and this is Milo,\u201d said Gemma awkwardly. \n\n\n\nWillow peeked her head out further and looked down on them.\n\n\n\n\u201cGemma, what an unusual name. Were you named after a rock?\u201d Willow said, with no smile at all. Gemma just ignored the question, as well as Milo giggling at it. \n\n\n\n\u201cWillow, we have no idea which door to open. Can you at least give us a hint?\u201d Gemma asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cA hint??\u201d shouted Willow. \u201cThe nerve! The gall! The outright\u2026 the bull-frogginess of it!\u201d \n\n\n\nGemma slouched down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to offend.\u201d\n\n\n\nWillow slammed the window making it disappear into the tree once again. They sat staring up at it for a minute. Gemma was about ready to give up when it opened again. Willow leaned out and addressed them, this time holding a piece of paper. \n\n\n\n\u201cAs it just so happens, I do have a hint,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI wrote it down years ago but no one\u2019s ever asked for it. No one\u2019s ever made it this far at all, actually. Anyone could\u2019ve made the same mistake!\u201d she added. \n\n\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d responded Gemma kindly.\n\n\n\n\u201cQuite,\u201d said Willow. She cleared her throat and read the paper aloud. \u201cDon\u2019t count on smell or feel or sight. The doors will tell you which is right.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma quintet her eyes and thought hard. After a great deal of pondering she was sure of only one thing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI need to hear it again,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou wish to hear it again,\u201d said Willow. \u201cYou need to pick the right door or you\u2019ll be kraken food in the Durg Sea.\u201d Willow shut the window one final time. \n\n9. NERVY\n\u201cYou gotta be kidding!\u201d expelled Gemma, throwing her hands into the air. Milo threw his hands up as high as they could go in support. \u201cWhy is everything a riddle?\u201d Milo shook his head furiously in support even more. \u201cMaybe we should just climb up the tree and crawl in the window instead. I wonder how Willow\u2019d feel about THAT!\u201d Milo paused. As a lemur, he was no stranger to climbing trees. However, this tree had no branches within reach and was wider than all the trees he\u2019d ever climbed added up and bunched together like twigs. He could not support this.\n\n\n\nGemma settled down in her usual way. She sighed, then stomped, then huffed, then sighed and stomped again. If was after the second stomp that she decided to get back down to business. She paced around as she recited what she could remember of the riddle.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe said, that the doors will tell us which is right.\u201d Gemma recalled, turning to the forest. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t use sight or smell or feel. She\u2019s talking about using our senses. And since there are five senses, that only leaves two.\u201d Gemma smiled and snapped her fingers. \u201cIt means we need to use either taste or sound to find the right door! And I think we both know which one she means\u2026 sound!\u201d \n\n\n\nGemma turned back to find Milo frozen, leaning towards the nearest door with his tongue sticking out, ready to lick. He had guessed taste. Milo slowly pulled his tongue back into his mouth, straightened up and gave an apologetic grin.\n\n\n\nGemma whispered as kindly as she could. \u201cYou need to stop licking things, Milo. How many times have I told you?\u201d \n\n\n\nMilo answered by raising four fingers, but, in fact, the right answer was five. To date, Milo had been caught licking a beehive, wet paint, a sea slug, and a particularly delicious looking bar of pink soap. The door made five, but given the circumstances, it is understandable that Milo did not think to count this instance, so soon after retracting his tongue.\n\n\n\nGemma joined him by the tree. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be sound. We need to listen to hear what\u2019s inside. You take this door and I\u2019ll take the other.\u201d They positioned themselves, each with an ear against a door. \u201cHear anything?\u201d Gemma asked.\n\n\n\nMilo heard nothing and shook his head. Gemma strained to hear a noise, any noise at all, inside. But there was none. She sighed, and was getting ready to stomp and huff, until something hit her. \n\n\n\n\u201cWait just a second. Willow said that one of these doors has stairs behind it, and the other is a hole that will suck us up and spit us out on the other side of the world.\u201d Milo shuddered at the reminder. Gemma reached down to the forest floor and brushed aside some brown and red leaves. She sifted through a group of rocks until she found two that were the size she was looking for. She handed one to a confused Milo and took her place back on the second door. \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, Milo. We need to knock on the doors and listen for an echo.\u201d Milo nodded and pressed his ear against the door again. He knocked three times on the door and listened. He knocked three more times. He knocked two more times. Then he knocked five times to a beat. \u201cMilo!\u201d Milo stopped and smiled at her. \n\n\n\n\u201cDid you hear an echo?\u201d Milo nodded and tossed the rock aside, going over to Gemma at her door.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat means there should be no echo from this door.\u201d Gemma knocked three times loudly, and both she and Milo listened. They heard no echo at all. Gemma gave one more hard knock. \u201cNothing. There must be stairs behind this one! If it was empty space then it would echo like yours did.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma put her hand on the brass knob and paused. Milo held her leg tight and closed his eyes. If she was right then their journey would continue. And if she was wrong, then it would end right now, at the bottom of the Durg Sea. \n\n\n\nHer hand was steady as she turned the knob. \n\n\n\nBut she never got a chance to push. \n\n\n\nThe door flew open and pulled her hand with it. \n\n\n\nMilo opened his eyes and saw Willow, holding a paintbrush and staring up at Gemma. \n\n\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t use rocks to knock on front doors,\u201d said Willow.\n\n 10. TOWERING\nWillow led Gemma and Milo up to her home, a few flights up inside the enormous tree. The staircase ended on a landing with furniture, among which were two comfortable chairs, a bookcase, and a bright slanted desk built into the side of the tree. Just to its right, Willow pushed on the wall until two slats popped and swung out. Gemma decided that the window was just as mysterious from the inside, and looked like any other spot on the wall until it was opened. She couldn\u2019t imagine how skilled of a carpenter had made such a feat. \n\n\n\nWillow sat down at the desk with an orange chair and dipped the paintbrush into a mug of water. Colors flowed from the tip and swirled in a storm of purples and yellows. Gemma noticed a dozen dips in the desk, as if a ball had been repeatedly pressed into it as it was made. Each one was filled with a different color paint. Too many colors for just one rainbow, Gemma thought. She took a moment to look around and realized that most of the wall was covered with beautiful paintings overlapping each other. There were mountains and rivers and creatures that Gemma had never seen before. Her eyes fixated on a majestic sea monster with two enormous fins and a long neck. \n\n\n\n\u201cThese paintings are wonderful! Where do you find your ideas?\u201d asked Gemma.\n\n\n\n\u201cWillow spun her chair around and stared at Gemma with narrow eyes. She studied her for just a moment, but long enough for Gemma to feel shy. \n\n\n\n\u201cDreams,\u201d replied Willow. \u201cI draw my dreams.\u201d In a flash, she spun back with her paintbrush in hand. She hovered between a puddle of sky blue paint and rose red. \u201cI used to draw\u2026 other things\u2026 but now I just draw my dreams.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI wish I could paint,\u201d said Gemma, sadly. In all her years at sea learning about the world, she had never gotten the hang of drawing and painting. She had decided long ago that it was for other people to be good at, not her.\n\n\n\nWillow stood up without a sound and walked over to face Gemma. She was at least a loaf of bread shorter, but her stare made Gemma feel small. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo use wishing for things you can have. Painting is just a way of talking with your hands,\u201d said Willow. The paintbrush dropped into Gemma\u2019s hands. \u201cFind your voice, dear girl.\u201d\n\n\n\nWillow hurried back over to her table and hopped back onto her chair. Reaching inside her jacket pocket, she pulled out another brush and dipped it firmly into the sky blue paint puddle. \n\n\n\n\u201cNow enough nonsense. I have work to do. it\u2019s time for you both to get moving,\u201d said Willow.\n\n\n\nGemma patted her shoulder and Milo hopped up. \u201cMoving? But, you haven\u2019t told us anything.\u201d Gemma squeezed the brush in her hand. \u201cAbout where we\u2019re supposed to go I mean\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nWillow laughed. \u201cWhere else would you go but the top?\u201d she asked. With brush in hand, Willow pointed to a section of clear wood on the wall to her right. Besides the window, it was one of the only places on the tree without paintings. To Gemma, it most resembled the shape of a door. And, my Dear Friend, as you well know, our first guesses are usually the best ones we have. Still unsure of herself, Gemma walked over and pushed against the wood, the same way that Willow had on the window. With the ease of wind on dry leaves, a door slid open to reveal another staircase. Gemma climbed onto the first step then looked back at Willow. She was at her desk, feverishly painting. Gemma squeezed her gift tightly again, then placed it into her backpack. \n\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Gemma. Willow didn\u2019t say another word, nor did she stop what she was doing, for a dream had come back to her and such fleeting things cannot be put aside for pleasantries. \n\n\n\nGemma and Milo ascended only a few steps before the door shut behind them. The design was so perfect that not a speck of light from Willow\u2019s home made it to the stairs. They climbed in darkness from there on out. It wasn\u2019t long before Gemma figured out the way of the staircase. It was winding, taking them up and up in what seemed like a never-ending spiral. They climbed for hours, taking only a few breaks to eat a small licorice snack or catch their breath. Milo didn\u2019t complain, even though each step for a human equals two steps for a lemur. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis\u2026 must\u2026 be\u2026 the\u2026 tallest-tree-ever!\u201d said Gemma. It seemed that with each flight of stairs, her legs were shouting louder for her to stop and plant herself, to become a part of the tree and grow roots. It was not soon after that, on step number 5,040 for her (and 10,080 for Milo), that she hit her head on a wooden board. She lifted it up and saw the dim glow of light above her. It was a trap door. They had finally reached the top. \n\n\n\nThey crawled up out of the stairwell and shut the trap door behind them. After a moment of cheering and exhausted high-fives, they looked around at their new surroundings, happy to be out of the dark and done with stairs. It was a circular room with a tall cylinder in the center. A large lantern was held fast on top of it. The walls and ceiling were covered by what looked like a large patchwork quilt. Only a wooden skeleton frame made it a room and kept the cloth from falling on them. Milo hopped onto the cylinder and noticed that there was a knob for the lantern (a lemur\u2019s eyes adjust to the dark much faster than a human\u2019s in cases such as this). With a shrug, Milo turned the lantern on.\n\n\n\nThe room began to shake. Instead of a small light, a huge flame had erupted from the lantern. The quilt began to rise over their heads. It reminded Gemma of her mother tucking her in at night. She would take the sheet on Gemma\u2019s bed and lift it up swiftly, then let it float down gently onto Gemma. But this time the quilt kept rising. Gemma held onto the nearest wooden post and braced herself. The walls of quilt expanded outward and upward towards the night sky. The moon hit both of their faces as the room was pushed up and off of the top of the tree. \n\nIt is easy to understand why Gemma had not realized it sooner, as this was the first time she had ever been inside a hot air balloon. \n\n11. SALTY \nThe thing about riding in a mysterious air balloon through the dark starry night, is that you do not get to decide where it goes. This might have worried most people and most lemurs, but Gemma and Milo laid down for the night, too exhausted to think. The basket of the balloon was large and thick enough that the cold sky air didn\u2019t bother them. Gemma asked Milo if he\u2019d like to cuddle up and got an enthusiastic nod in return. Soon, they fell asleep, nestled up, and cozier than anyone had a right to be inside a floating hot air balloon. \n\n\n\nGemma dreamed of the night her mom took her to the waterfall. She remembered the glistening stream. She pictured the bright stars shining in the sky. The mud. The gold. And her mother. \u201cThe stuff of dreams,\u201d she murmured in her sleep. There were still parts that she couldn\u2019t remember from that night. It had been so long ago. She had tried not to think about it. The days that followed, the days after her parents went away, were even more of a blur. She had been given a tearful goodbye and put on a train north. After that she was passed to and fro and ushered from here to there by friends of her parents. Some called themselves aunts or uncles and bragged about how far back they go. Others told her remarkable and dramatic stories of how they met her parents. Usually it was a grand adventure that Gemma was too young to remember or too not-yet-born to have been there. There was a gruff man with extensive knowledge of plants, a set of twins who were born in the desert region or Astronia and longed to go back, and an archeologist who had only met her parents a few times, but was excited that they had asked her for a favor. Gemma could remember at least a dozen of them. More than that, she remembered the one thing they all seemed to agree on: they wouldn\u2019t tell Gemma a thing about where her parents had gone. Whenever she asked, they would tense up like a cold clam in an ice bath. \u201cIt\u2019s not my business to say,\u201d said a particularly chatty woman, who certainly thought everything else was her business, and who continued on with a story about her sister\u2019s broken foot. \n\n\n\nIt was the young archeologist who finally dropped Gemma off by carriage next to a long, warped dock on the edge of Harbortown. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d said the archeologist, unloading Gemma\u2019s bags. \u201cI have so many things I\u2019d like to discuss with your parents. Do tell them that I said I \u2018hello\u2019! You will won\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\nGemma looked up with a blank expression.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen\u2026 you see them next I mean\u2026\u201d added the archeologist, realizing her mistake and beginning to panic. \u201cWhich, I\u2019m sure will be soon. Or\u2026 you know\u2026 sooner than you think at least!\u201d she said, digging up a smile from a time she had meant it, dusting it off, and offering it up to Gemma as genuine. \n\n\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Gemma. The carriage rode off and Gemma sat on the edge of the dock, dangling her feet over the edge. She always loved staring at the water. It calmed her and called to her at the same time. If she had stared any longer she would have fancied a swim, even then. But, a familiar voice, the first familiar voice she had heard in weeks, called out to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis cannot be my Gemma,\u201d bellowed her Uncle Horace. His tree trunk arms lifted her onto her feet and then right off them again, in what was, to date, the best hug she had ever gotten. \u201cMy Gemma is as tiny as a rabbit. This young lady is much too grown and distinguished to be my Gemma.\u201d He squeezed her tightly and Gemma felt the weeks of travel leave her in a puff of salty breath.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere have my parents gone to?\u201d she asked, hearing then that she was crying. \u201cWhen can I go home?\u201d\n\n\n\nUncle Horace set her down and crouched until they were eye to eye. \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where they will be,\u201d answered Horace. \u201cAnd the truth is neither do they.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma wiped the tears from her eyes. The first honest answer she had gotten in weeks, terrible as it was, gave her strength she hadn\u2019t expected. \n\n\n\nHorace grabbed her bags and started walking towards the far end of the dock to a row of three boats. \n\n\n\n\u201cAs for a home, mine is the sea. Come, let me show you around,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nGemma spent the next few years traveling the world with her Uncle Horace. For the first few months she stopped at every port to ask if there had been word from her parents. Soon it became less frequent, until, finally, she stopped asking altogether. Instead, she focused on her uncle\u2019s lessons, each building on the last. First, she learned the ways of the sea, learning how to clean the boat. Then, to repair it. Navigation came easiest of all. On land, her uncle taught her about new cultures, new foods, and new skills. She spent months learning accounting in Far Roeth. She learned trading and negotiation in Marlington. Tracking in Greenworth. Fighting in Tarpith. Her uncle showed her the wonders that her parents had kept secret from her. By the time she was ready to be a captain herself she had learned everything there was to learn about a seafaring life. But, it was waking up from a peaceful sleep on the floor of the hot air balloon that she realized the biggest lesson he had taught her. Gemma had learned to make any place her home. \n\n 12. HIDDEN\nThe hot air balloon sailed over a snow-topped mountain just as the sun was coming up. Milo asked to be picked up to see the view. He sat on Gemma\u2019s shoulders and looked out over the landscape, the full view of everything around them. Past the mountain there were rolling green hills as far they both could see. \n\n\n\nOn the horizon, the last point before the earth curved away from view, Gemma caught a glimpse of something shining. As the balloon moved closer, she realized it was the glint of the sun hitting water. It was a beautiful lake and it was getting larger by the second. It was growing, not just because they were moving over it, but because they were also dropping towards it! The balloon started falling, slow and smooth, towards the lake.\n\n\n\nIn the very center, there was a circle that wasn\u2019t shining with the sun\u2019s reflection. No water. It was a circle of dry land. The water was held back by a stone wall, and in the center of the circle there was a small silver dome. When you put it all together: the lake, the circle, and the dome, it looked like a bullseye, and they were right on target. The balloon cleared both the water and the wall, and touched down onto the dirt floor. It kicked up some dust and stopped just in front of the silver dome. \n\n\n\n\u201cSeems like this is our stop,\u201d said Gemma.\n\n\n\nGemma and Milo stepped out of the balloon by unlatching a thin wicker door. She hadn\u2019t seen the door in the dark of Willow\u2019s tree, which was a lucky thing, since opening it then would have led nowhere good. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is, Milo?\u201d asked Gemma, staring straight up the slope of the dome. It was made up of curved panels. Each one stretched to a hole on top, a little closer to the side where they stood. Gemma and Milo split up and walked around the base from opposite directions. She ran her hand along the side panels, hoping that she was missing something, hoping that there was a way in that she hadn\u2019t yet spotted. When Milo passed her on the other side with a shrug, Gemma was more confused than ever. They finished their loops just to be certain. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow are we supposed to get in?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\nMilo pointed to the hole above them and got into a crouching position.\n\n\n\nGemma asked with concern, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo nodded and set his sights on the hole.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d she said. Gripping him by the fur on his back and winding up. \u201cGood\u2026 LUCK!\u201d Gemma flung Milo through the air as high as she could. He set his arms out straight ahead to aid his flight. But, barely a second later, Milo hit the side of the dome with a THUD, and came sliding back down, screeching against the metal. He dropped down next to Gemma and shook his head. All he could do was look up with a frown.\n\n\n\n\u201cMay I hug you?\u201d asked Gemma. Milo nodded and got a squeeze from Gemma that made him instantly smile. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a great try,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there must be another way in. Not everyone has a high-flying friend like you.\u201d Gemma reached out and touched the side of the dome again. She knocked on the thick metal. \u201cWe can\u2019t go through, there\u2019s no door.\u201d She looked up at the hole that Milo had tried to reach. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t go over it. What does that leave us?\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo looked down at his feet. That\u2019s when she spotted a small hole. It was just like the holes they had seen inside the cave on the Forgotten Island. He jumped up and down and pointed until Gemma saw it. She recognized it instantly, not just from the cave, but also from the jungle so long ago, where she met the golden mole. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWe need to go under, like a mole would! That\u2019s why the wall is holding back the water. So we can dig!\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo and Gemma dug with their hands for a long while. In fact, they spent the whole day digging. They only took breaks for food and water, both of which were running low. By the start of dusk, they had dug below the side of the dome, and finally poked through on the other side. A small pile of dirt started to form inside the dome, along the edge, as Gemma and Milo\u2019s hole got bigger and bigger. When it was wide enough, Milo crawled through and dug from inside. Within minutes Gemma was able to pull herself through with enough space to be comfortable. She popped up and looked around. It was like nothing she\u2019d ever seen. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is this place, Milo?\u201d Gemma asked. Milo couldn\u2019t answer her because he was a lemur, but equally so, because he had no idea. It had taken them exactly two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail to look around, since there was really only one object inside, if you don\u2019t count them and their pile of dirt, Dear Friend. It was an enormous wooden tube, set on a complicated structure and angled up towards the hole in the dome. Without a word more, they both walked towards it. \n\n\n\nThe light of the day was fading and it would be dark in a few minutes. Gemma touched the tube. She saw a much smaller tube attached at the low end, facing up towards them. And she saw a set of dials. It was then that she realized what it was. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a telescope!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cMy mom showed me how to use one when I was little. It\u2019s bigger than any one I\u2019ve ever seen in real life, though.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut, she had seen one that large in a book called The Extraordinarily Essential Guide to Modern Marvels. It belonged to her uncle\u2019s friend Martha Groundgrable, the \u201csecond-best adventurer around\u201d, as her uncle would call her. As the two of them recounted tales from their journeys across the Eight Seas, Gemma would read the massive book quietly. She had seen a room like this before. Only, it was filled with dozens of people, all boring looking, Gemma remembered. And the telescope in the center was made of a shiny metal. Still, she recognized the set up well.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know where we are? This is an observatory!\u201d she said to Milo. Milo smiled and nodded like he had known all along, but Dear Friend, he had not. \n\n\n\nGemma now knew that the small tube was actually an eyepiece. \u201cThat\u2019s where you look through,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd you move these dials to move the big tube all around to look at different spots in the sky. And this book\u2026\u201d Gemma picked up a book that was resting on a small platform near the eyepiece. \u201c\u2026 well I\u2019m not sure what this book is, actually.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe cover was black, without any words. She thumbed through the pages and it was more of the same. Black and blank. \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she wondered, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of a book with nothing inside. But as the sunlight left the observatory, and the little bit of light that was peeking through the hole in the top fluttered away, something changed. The cover started to shine in a thousands little dots. They were stars. A galaxy\u2019s worth. Gemma opened up the book and found that the pages had stars now too, lit up to show constellations.  Each constellation had their name underneath, and numbers beside them. \n\n\n\nGemma knew that the numbers were settings, and that turning the dials to those numbers would show her a constellation when she looked through the eyepiece. Her mom had taught her well. \n\n\n\n\u201cCetus\u201d she read allowed. That\u2019s the sea monster constellation.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo looked scared and hid behind her leg. Gemma couldn\u2019t help but chuckle.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s nothing to be scared of, Milo. A constellation is just a group of stars. Ancient explorers drew the stars that they saw and then connected the dots to make the shapes of animals and objects. Mom always used to say they were drawing in the sky.\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo relaxed and nodded along again.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of them are fantastical creatures. I used to know them all,\u201d she continued as she flipped through the pages. \u201cMonoceros, that\u2019s the unicorn constellation\u2026 and this one is Phoenix. Let\u2019s try that one!\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma moved the dials carefully until they read the same as the numbers that were glowing brightly on the page. As she turned the knobs, the entire dome and telescope spun round slowly. Milo had to grab on to the base to not fall over. Next the telescope tilted up until it pointed almost right above their heads. The hole followed the telescope in a mystical way. The curved metal slats that made up the dome moved and slid around to make sure of it.\n\n\n\nWhen it stopped moving, Gemma looked through the eyepiece with wonder. \n\n\n\n\u201cMy gosh, Milo! There it is. And more clear than ever!\u201d Gemma said with a smile.\n\n\n\nMilo looked through next and couldn\u2019t hide his excitement either. As he looked at the constellation, Gemma searched through the book once again. It was on the 24th page that she froze. Her fingers stopped on the constellation she was meant to find, and she hadn\u2019t heard its name since the night her mother left. \n\n 13. BLURRY\n\u201cThe stuff of dreams,\u201d said Gemma\u2019s mom. Young Gemma looked up at the point in the sky where her mom was looking. It was the first constellation that she had ever been shown, when she was a little smaller and her hair a little lighter.\n\n\n\n\u201cPyxis,\u201d Gemma whispered. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said her mom. \u201cIt\u2019s the mariner\u2019s compass. Do you know what that means?\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma looked at her mom and thought. She always liked the name \u201cPyxis,\u201d even if it was almost impossible to say when she had a loose tooth. But, she had never thought about what it meant. She shook her head.\n\n\n\n\u201cA mariner is someone who sails the ocean,\u201d Gemma\u2019s mom said. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 like a sailor?\u201d Gemma asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cExactly. And a compass is a tool. It helps you figure out which way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma looked back at the constellation. It looked to her like it was twinkling. She had never seen anything so beautiful. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be sending you to stay with your Uncle Horace at his harbor. He\u2019ll teach you how to sail. But, I need you to remember something\u2026\u201d said Gemma\u2019s Mom.\n\n\n\nGemma stared even harder at Pyxis. Trying not to look at her mom. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter where you go, Pyxis will be there to help guide you. It will always be with you. Just like your father and I,\u201d she finished. \n\n\n\nThe stars turned blurry through Gemma\u2019s tears. \n\n\n\nInside an observatory in the middle of a lake, fifteen years later, Gemma knew what she had to do. She repeated the numbers to herself that were next to the drawing of Pyxis inside the book. She turned the dials on the telescope carefully, one then the other. Slowly, the telescope spun around, and it\u2019s great tube tilted downward. When it stopped, Gemma knew that it had found her constellation. \n\n\n\nShe knew exactly what she would see when she peered inside the eyepiece. The brightest biggest image of Pyxis she had ever seen. But, what she didn\u2019t expect was the soft *thud* of something dropping at her feet. A silver scroll rolled until it tapped the front of her shoes. She pulled away and picked it up, barely noticing the scattered holes around the telescope from golden moles. \n\n\n\nMilo twisted his head and looked up underneath the dials. He pointed to a secret compartment that had held the scroll, tucked away out of sight. When Gemma turned the telescope to Pyxis, it had opened up and dropped the telescope, without a care for any lemurs that might have been hit by it, Milo noted. \n\n\n\n\u201cA secret within a secret,\u201d thought Gemma. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is, Milo?\u201d she asked. But before even his eager hands could grab the scroll to look, they were surprised again by a noise. This time, it was one they had heard before. \n\n\n\nIt gave her a peculiar feeling, to hear the familiar jingle of her brass bell, inside some new and odd place. Gemma turned to see her old friend, who was not a friend at all, the jaguar. He was prowling around the hole that they had climbed in from. \n\n\n\nGemma clutched the scroll and stepped in front of Milo to protect him. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou again! How in the world did you get here?\u201d she asked. That\u2019s when Gemma realized that it wasn\u2019t just the bell she recognized. The bell was attached to her purple ribbon again, wrapped around the jaguar\u2019s neck. \n\n\n\nGemma took a step back. \u201cBut\u2026 how is that possible? How\u2019d you get my ribbon back?\u201d she asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cI would have introduced us all properly\u2026\u201d said a voice from the tunnel. \u201cBut this hole is a bit more snug than I expected. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat voice\u2026\u201d said Gemma.\n\n\n\nGemma and Milo stood wide-eyed, as Charles Bucket, with his hat on his head, crawled out of the hole. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d asked Charles. \n\n 14. COMBATIVE\n\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to thank you. My jaguar had grown quite fond of his ribbon back, and he\u2019s happy to have it back,\u201d said Charles Bucket.\n\n\n\nThe jaguar paced back and forth and then sat next to Charles Bucket. Gemma did what many people do when they are scared and have a thousand important questions going through their mind. She asked a completely different one. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your jaguar\u2019s name, anyway?\u201d she asked, trying to act as cool as possible.\n\n\n\nCharles Bucket raised his chest indignantly. \u201cName? Why would he have a name? He\u2019s mine and he does what I want, that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma had an instinct to clutch the scroll even harder. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked. \n\n\n\nCharles Bucket took a step forward. \u201cDo you know what it is that you\u2019re holding, Gemma?\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma answered more honestly than she expected. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo! No one will tell me and it\u2019s starting to get annoying,\u201d she snapped. \n\n\n\nCharles Bucket walked over to the telescope, just as Gemma and Milo backed away from it. He looked through the eyepiece and smiled as he spoke.\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, Pyxis, of course.\u201d He turned back towards Gemma. \u201cDo you know why the explorers of old made constellations? It was a way of communicating. Painting with the stars.\u201d he said, answering his own question, a habit that Gemma never liked. \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she said with an attitude. \u201cAnd painting is a way of speaking with your hands.\u201d\n\n\n\nCharles Bucket smiled large. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met Willow. Did you know that she made what you\u2019re holding?\u201d Gemma tapped her shoulder and Milo jumped on.\n\n\n\nGemma wondered allowed, \u201cWillow drew it? You mean, it\u2019s a \u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA map, my dear Gemma,\u201d Charles Bucket finished.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most greatest treasure in the world\u2026\u201d Gemma whispered. \n\n\n\nCharles Bucket took an angry step towards her. \u201cUgh! Your parents called it that! It\u2019s a childish name.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy parents?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe map holds secrets. Secrets they search for even now. A foolish endeavor without the map. And now I finally have it!\u201d\n\n\n\nExcept, Dear Friend, he did not have it. Because feeling that something is yours, and it being yours are two very different things.\n\n\n\nGemma rubbed the scroll with her fingers. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis was what my parents were trying to find? This is why they left?\u201d she said, looking off into the distance, which, in this case, was the wall of the observatory three feet from her. \u201cIt was so long ago, I can hardly\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh what does it matter!\u201d Charles interrupted. \u201cYou led me to it and now it\u2019s mine!\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma was beginning to understand. Connecting the dots like stars in a constellation. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been following me,\u201d she shot back.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course I have. In the Dusty Rust Busket,\u201d he answered.\n\n\n\nGemma and Milo smirked at each other. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt really is the worst name,\u201d she quipped.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh nothing,\u201d she answered, looking innocent.\n\n\n\n\u201cEnough! Give it here!\u201d With the jaguar by his side, Charles Bucket lurched forward to grab the scroll from Gemma. Without a word or a thought, Gemma tucked it behind her back. Milo swung down, swiped it from her, and ran to the other side of the observatory. It was, to that day, the best handoff they\u2019d ever pulled off. \n\n\n\nCharles Bucket slowly approached Milo, taking his time to make sure the lemur couldn\u2019t escape past him. Meanwhile, the jaguar went after Gemma, backing her away until she bumped into the side of the dome. They were cornered, the both of them.\n\n\n\nGemma felt something poking her in the back. Spinning around, she saw that there was a plaque, and below it, protruding from the wall, the hollow base of a switch. The jaguar was closing in, and she hadn\u2019t much time to read the words. The writing was faded, but she was still able to make out the letters.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore you leave\u2026\u201d she read, \u201cplease seal the door. Protect the secret, ever more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another riddle!\u201d Gemma said aloud. Lucky for her, and for Milo, and for all of us, Dear Friend, Charles Bucket did not pay attention to her words. He had only the scroll on his mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go, little monkey,\u201d said Charles Bucket as he reached out to grab it. Milo shook with fear, clutching the scroll against his beating chest.\n\n\n\nGemma looked at Milo. Her heart hurt, seeing him scared. She had less than no time to figure out the riddle, but it wasn\u2019t the words that struck her. It was the switch. All that was needed to pull the switch would be a long thin instrument. A tiny satchel hung at her side, and opened with ease. It used to be her brass bell that she kept inside, but with it hanging around the neck of an approaching jaguar, she found something else instead. Something long. Something thin. \n\nShe pulled out Willow\u2019s paintbrush and locked it in place on the switch.\n\n\n\nCharles Bucket grabbed Milo by the arm harshly and reached for the scroll. Gemma\u2019s eyes grew wide with anger.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a monkey!\u201d shouted Gemma. \u201cHe\u2019s a ring-tailed lemur!\u201d\n\n\n\nCharles Bucket turned to Gemma, still holing Milo.\n\n\n\nShe pulled down on the switch until there was a loud click. \u201cAnd he did not give you permission to touch him.\u201d\n\n\n\nA low rumble began to shake the observatory. The jaguar\u2019s eyes darted back and forth, looking for the source of it. The noise grew as the walls of the observatory started to creak and shimmy. All four sets of eyes found the hole that they had crawled in from. Water shot up to the top of the observatory. Smaller streams came rushing up out of the golden mole holes. Faster than Gemma could understand why, the lake water was filling the observatory.\n\n 15. SNEAKY\nThe water spun friends and enemies alike. Gemma, Milo, Charles Bucket, and the jaguar were caught up in the whirlpool as the water filled the dome. The scroll, knocked loose from Milo\u2019s hand, was swimming freely too. Charles Bucket reached out to grasp it but missed by just a hair. The jaguar, used to meals on the run, tried to bite for it with his teeth. He missed it by a hair so small that it is smaller than the smallest hair on your head, after a haircut. Gemma tried to steady herself by grabbing on to the large tube of the telescope with her arm, but she slipped away. She whirled and swirled and began to feel dizzy. Moments later, as she came back around, she grabbed at the telescope with both arms in desperation and got hold. Milo was trying desperately to swim against the current to reach the scroll. \n\n\n\nCharles Bucket grabbed the jaguar and flung him towards the scroll. The jaguar let out a terrible yelp as he was tossed around by the paw. Milo ducked under the water and made one last attempt to reach the scroll. When he popped back up, Gemma saw him, with his sopping face and big yellow eyes. \n\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t care about the scroll. She didn\u2019t care about Charles Bucket or Willow or rabbits or ships. She didn\u2019t even care about \u201cthe most greatest treasure in the world.\u201d Milo was her friend. There was no greater treasure than a friend like Milo. He\u2019d stuck with her though it all, and it was her job to keep him safe. As he spun by her, Gemma caught him by the arm and slowly pulled him towards the telescope. \n\n\n\n\u201cForget the scroll, Milo! We need to get out of here.\u201d Gemma pushed Milo up the telescope and then hugged it tight. Milo started climbing towards the top, which Gemma knew housed a great glass lens. It was still pointed to the hole in the top of the dome, and that\u2019s where they needed to get. As they reached the rim Gemma looked back down. Charles Bucket and the jaguar were thrashing around in the water, desperately looking for the scroll. \n\n\n\nWith their feet on the glass lens, Gemma and Milo lifted themselves up and out of the observatory. By then, Charles Bucket and his enraged jaguar were climbing up behind them. They saw that the lake had flooded the dry circle of land where they once landed, and the balloon was nowhere in sight. Only that small space at the very top of the observatory was above the water. No bigger than a trampoline. It was shrinking at a rapid pace. And soon they would be joined by unfriendliest of guests. \n\n\n\nThen Gemma saw something that she had not counted on.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d yelled Gemma. \n\n\n\nThe Dusty Rust Busket, almost as if on cue, was sailing on its own towards them, riding the waves of water. It was a poorly named. It was cluttered. And dusty. And absolutely rusty. But at that moment, Gemma had never seen a more beautiful boat. She tapped her shoulder and Milo swung up. She bent her knees and readied herself as it approached. \n\n\n\n\u201cOne\u2026Two\u2026Three!\u201d Gemma and Milo jumped aboard, knocking over cans and keepsakes and trinkets. In a flash, she was up and at the steering wheel, turning the boat as far away from the dome as she could. And it was a lucky thing too, because Charles Bucket and his jaguar were a mere seconds behind them. As the boat pulled away, safely out of reach. Charles Bucket stood up and stared at Gemma. His jaguar shook his whole body, spewing drops of water like a sprinkler. Gemma heard her grandma\u2019s bell jingle once again. The sea wind on her damp clothes made her cold. But it was Charles Bucket\u2019s smile that made her shiver. \n\n\n\nGemma found a stream that fed the lake and made their escape. It gave way to a narrow but strong river which, soon, would open up into the sea.\n\n\n\nThe stars were all Gemma needed to navigate the seas, and later that night she would charter a course to Harbortown. She had much and more to discuss with her Uncle Horace. The adventure, it seemed, was over.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe made it, Milo,\u201d she said, steering the boat like it had always been hers. She wove around rocks and trees that jutted out over the river like arms. Milo smiled and raised a finger to get her attention, but Gemma was busy in thought.\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, we didn\u2019t get the scroll, but we\u2019re safe. And that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\nMilo coughed loudly, trying to grab Gemma\u2019s attention again.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough, we still don\u2019t know what was on that map, even after all this time,\u201d she continued.\n\n\n\nMilo waved his arms at her, but she kept her gaze on the river, as any good captain would.\n\n\u201cAnd now Charles Bucket has it, and\u2026 can we talk about him for a second? Can you believe what he\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo jumped up and down and squeaked as loudly as he could, finally drawing her confused stare.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Milo?\u201d she asked. Standing in front of Gemma, Milo raised his tail from behind his back. It was clasping a shiny, slightly wet, silver scroll. \n\n\n\nThere was a brief, and beautiful pause.\n\n\n\n\u201cMilo!\u201d Gemma screamed with a smile. \u201cYou got the scroll! You wonderful, brilliant, little lemur!\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo smiled too big for his face and blushed underneath his fur. He handed her the scroll, but with his tail. You might say he \u201ctailed\u201d it to her, if that word didn\u2019t already have another meaning. \n\n\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re finally going to see what it is,\u201d Gemma said, not able to contain her excitement even a little.\n\n\n\nGemma taped her shoulder and Milo hopped up to see. With their faces towards the river, as the Dusty Rust Busket opened up into the vast sea, Gemma opened the scroll. Her smile turned to surprise and wonder. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2026 can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d she said. \u201cAll those years ago\u2026\u201d\n\n 16. ILLUMINATING\nYoung Gemma\u2019s tears blurred her eyes. The waterfall became nothing more than sparkling lights cascading down into the stream. Her parents would be leaving her, and she didn\u2019t know for how long.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to look for?\u201d Gemma demanded. \u201cTell me what it is!\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom let out a sigh. She kept her eyes on the constellation Pyxis as she spoke. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat if I told you that there are magical creatures, Gemma. Real life magical creatures,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\n\u201cLike, unicorns?\u201d Gemma asked, drying her eyes. Her mom\u2019s question had thrown her, and she was definitely going to need more information before returning to her fit of crying.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, unicorns. And sea monsters and centaurs and griffins and mermaids and so many more,\u201d Gemma\u2019s mom answered. \n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s eyes were wide with wonder. These were some of her favorite things to talk about in the world. But, rarely, were they brought up by people who were not her.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd what if I told you there\u2019s a map that tells you how to find them all? What would you say?\u201d asked her mom.\n\n\n\nGemma thought long and hard. Her tears already drying in the corners of her eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s the most greatest treasure in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma\u2019s mom turned to her daughter and laughed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll call it then,\u201d she said, crouching down and hugging her daughter. \u201cWe will go find the treasure and come back to you. But Gemma?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered, hugging back with all her might.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou will always be our greatest discovery. There is nothing more precious to us than you.\u201d Gemma\u2019s mom held her out and looked her in the eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why we named you Gemma.\u201d\n\n\n\nTears found Gemma again, years later, on the deck of The Dusty Rust Busket. \n\n\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2026 could it really be true?\u201d\n\n\n\nMilo\u2019s tail curled around her neck as he leaned in closely to the map.\n\n\n\nIt covered all the world and the Eight Seas. There were drawings of fantastical creatures and landmarks and dotted paths to sail them there. It was a map to magical creatures. It was the treasure that her family had been searching for since she was a child. \n\n\n\n\u201cWonders unseen,\u201d whispered Gemma. \u201cAnd everyone is looking for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGemma licked her finger and held it up to check for wind. She cleared off a small table on the deck and laid the map out, holding it down with a metal gear and clay mug. Searching through a box of cloth, Gemma tore off a thin strip of ribbon and made a second braid in her hair. At the helm of The Dusty Rust Busket, Captain Gemma turned the ship towards the Cascade Sea.\n\nMilo climbed onto the bow of the boat and felt the cool air on his face.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s looking for them,\u201d Gemma shouted over the sea. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to find them.\u201d\n\n 17. OPEN\nOn Marsan Island, in the mild southern waters of the Cascade Sea, Gemma and Milo trekked up a grassy hill. The wind was blowing them forward, pushing them towards the top. A dozen small streams lined with mossy rocks wove in and around the grass at their feet. The blue sky connected to the sea all around them. \n\n\n\nThey had traveled for weeks, through harsh waves and fierce storms. They were the kind that only an experienced sea captain could navigate. Lucky for us, Gemma was that, and more. She and her \u201cfirst primate\u201d Milo, as he was now officially called, had made it to their first stop: a small island, that no-one had ever heard of, but someone had named a lifetime ago. An island that only one map in the world could take you to. There were few alive who knew it by name, and fewer still who knew how to pronounce it. As it happens, Dear Friend, I must admit that I am not one of them.\n\n\n\nGemma held the map out in front of her. She enlisted a trick that she had learned soon after inspecting it. For reasons unknown to her, when Gemma pulled on a section of the map, it would expand, becoming larger and more clear. New words would appear with finer details. It was beyond the abilities of any map that Gemma had ever seen. It was how she navigated the Strait of Hornsway. It was how she found the secret turn in the rocky waters of the Mosaic Sea. It was impossibly magical. But then, most of what had happened since Gemma started her adventure was, too. And according to her map, there was something even more magical up ahead. Something worth protecting with an ancient guild of explorers, shielding with riddles, and hiding away on a secret map. \n\n\n\nGemma and Milo came to the top, the crest, of the hill. The wind blew past her face and then stopped as she looked down on a green valley. The rolling hills were breathtaking. But they were nothing compared to what she saw next. Down the slope, in a small bright clearing, twelve unicorns were grazing.\n\n\n\nFor the first time in her life, Gemma was speechless. Milo was equally speechless, but much more used to it. As they walked towards the unicorns, they couldn\u2019t know what lay ahead, but then again, that\u2019s always the way with adventurers. \n\n\n\nAnd so, Dear Friend, now the story has been told, for the first time, but maybe not the last. \n\nThat, as a handsome mustachioed sea merchant once said, is up to you.\n\nEPILOGUE ONE\nThe harbormaster of Harbortown was well-known for being selective. He looked after well the boats of locals, friends, and those who paid him for protection. Uncle Horace was all three. Given the bounty of loot he had discovered in a wreck somewhere in the south current of the Azul Sea, he\u2019d thought it best to slip the harbormaster an extra twenty starlings to keep a watchful eye. There would be no bandits or young mischief-makers disturbing his boat, The Singing Nomad, for as long as he held port. \n\nSo, it was at the Starlight Tavern, enjoying a pheasant pot-pie, that a sealed letter found Horace, delivered by a local messenger girl. \n\nShe waited for a rare moment between bites to make herself known at the far end of his booth. \n\n\u201cExcuse me sir, are you Captain Horace\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cCaptain Horace is fine,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u2019 he added kindly.\n\n\u201cBeen holding onto this for you for a good week now,\u201d she said, handing him the letter. It was a silver material that shined almost to a glow. \u201cIt looks important. Never seen anything like it before come this way.\u201d\n\nHorace\u2019s first name was written on the front in an impressive form of cursive long forgotten by the sailors and merchants with whom he did business. He flipped it over and inspected the wax seal, which had bright hues of green and blue and orange and pink. It was imprinted with a circle, which had a great tree in the center. \n\nHe slid a short candle over and pushed aside the almost empty pot-pie tin. Horace reached for a the knife on his belt and opened the letter with ease. The young girl watched his eyes as he scrolled through the words:\n\n\u201cDear Unknown Explorers,\n\nIt is not lightly that I break my solitude to write you. As you know, I have been charged with keeping a secret from long ago. In truth, I keep but a part of this secret. A piece of a path.\n\nI was informed that this secret has been under attack from a former member of our guild. In times such as these it is my duty to report on any happenings. Three weeks ago, I was visited by someone on their path to the secret. They were both determined and capable of finding it. \n\nI find it equally important to report that it was not a former member of our guild, nor was it a current member. It was a young girl named Gemma, and her lemur companion.\n\nDo with this information what you will. Feeling that I have fulfilled my duties, I shall depart from my post and return to exploring. There are many maps still yet to draw.\u201d\n\nThe signature was written with the most beautiful penmanship that Horace had ever seen.\n\nThe young girl noted when he was finished and took a shy step forward. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry sir, but we\u2019ve all been wondering what was in the letter. Was it a secret message? The seal was a tree of some kind right? Is that part of the secret? I really don\u2019t mean to pry sir, but\u2026\u201d\n\nHorace raised his hand slowly. He reached inside a pouch at his waist with the other hand and placed five starlings on the table for her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done your job very well, friend. And I thank you for it\u2026\u201d\n\nHe stood up from the table and rolled the letter into a large sack on his shoulder. \n\n\u201cBut secrets cannot survive such questions.\u201d\n\nAs he walked past her, he bowed his head slightly and put on his tricorn hat. \n\n\u201cAnd the tree that you speak of is called a Willow.\u201d he finished. \n\nWith that, Horace left the tavern and set off to find his first mate to ready the crew for an early departure.\n\n EPILOGUE TWO\nGemma\u2019s father pulled out his weathered tome and flipped to the worn section with scribbled drawings from ancient caves. It was the same as it was the last time he checked. And the time before that. And each of the fourteen times that he had checked on their way to the ruins. \n\nHe placed the book on the ground and held the pages down with two odd shaped rocks. He pointed to the east and noticed the same hills that were drawn on the pages at his feet. He pointed to the west and found the small forest, exactly where it should be. This was the place. \n\n\u201cAny luck?\u201d Gemma\u2019s mom asked, as she cut through some brush and caught up. \n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut this must be the place. These ancient texts describe a creature that could only be one thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t lived here for centuries, Arthur,\u201d she said.\n\nHe glanced at the book one more time then lowered his hands. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here. I can feel it,\u201d he insisted. \n\n\u201cJust like you felt it in the Slithering Sea. And just like you felt it on Mount Thorn? And just like\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is different, Jean,\u201d he interrupted with a frown.\n\nShe came and stood by his side. Her tone changed.\n\n\u201cI believe it,\u201d she said, grabbing his hand.\n\nHe looked around the stone ruins. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected: that some mythical creature would be waiting for us with bells on?\u201d\n\nJean smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep looking. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some page in that book that you haven\u2019t read yet that tells you exactly where to find them.\u201d\n\nThey both laughed, knowing that there was no page in the book that hadn\u2019t been read a dozen times, and then a dozen times more. Arthur sighed and bent down to pick up the book. As he lifted it up to his chest, the rocks tumbled down and caught his eye. He stared at the ground by his feet for a few seconds. He stared at the exact same spot that he had covered up with his book.\n\n\u201cJean\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d she replied.\n\nArthur didn\u2019t have to say a word. She followed his eyes until they both saw a footprint that had only ever been seen in drawings. The footprint of a phoenix.\n\n EPILOGUE THREE\nCharles Bucket arrived back at his mansion with debris and muck in his hair that he was yet to notice. His jaguar followed behind, with his head down and his paws sore. His bell was no longer jingling, having been filled with dirt and specks of leaf. \n\nCharles called for his servant and dropped his hat onto the ground next to the door.\n\n\u201cSanders!\u201d he shouted. \n\nA shorter, stout man came rushing from three rooms away and skidded to a halt in front of the pair.\n\n\u201cSir, are you all right?\u201d he asked with a shocked face.\n\n\u201cNevermind that. Draw me a bath,\u201d Charles barked.\n\nSanders, usually quick to do as he was told, stood there for a moment with all the questions in his head.\n\n\u201cNOW!\u201d shouted Charles Bucket. \n\nSanders nodded and rang a bell from the mahogany stand at his side. Two older servants came shuffling in next to him.\n\n\u201cGo and make Captain Bucket a bath. Extra heat and extra soap.\u201d They bowed and shuffled down the great hall behind them.\n\n\u201cSanders, take down a list,\u201d Charles started. Sanders whipped out a piece of paper from his vest pocket and pulled out a pencil, ready to write. \u201cI need a new boat. No trickery this time. A vessel worthy of me. The largest you can buy. And get me a crew of sailors, NO\u2026 make that pirates. And bring me Professor Roderick. I require something\u2026 different.\u201d\n\nSanders nodded and hid the paper back into his pocket and then reached down to grab the jaguar\u2019s collar. The jaguar nuzzled up to Sanders with a small purr. Sanders gave him a secret pet and smile, making sure that Charles could not see. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him back to the South Wing,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nCharles made off down the great hall towards the baths with a half wave and hardly a grunt.\n\nSanders led the jaguar to the grand door at the entrance of the South Wing. He pushed it open with his free hand to reveal an enormous chamber. It was filled with ten separate pens. Toucans, lizards, bison, giraffes, lions, armadillos, hawks, horses, and zebras where just some of the hundreds of creatures that occupied the caged habitats. With a technique that he had learned the hard way, Sanders opened the gate to the nearest pen and swiftly shut it behind the jaguar, who was greeted by his family with purrs and nuzzles and licks. Sanders reached into his other vest pocket and took out a snack, tossing it inside to the jaguars and their cubs. \n\nThen, he hurried out of the South Wing and shut the grand door behind him. He would spend the afternoon sending for various merchants and traders, and his least favorite person in the world, Professor Roderick.

It did not take him long to get there because he was such a fantastically fast and fancy flier. \n\n \n\nThe cricket landed next to a pine tree as the sun began setting.\n\n \n\n \n\nThere was snow everywhere he looked. \n\nThere was snow on the trees.\n\nThere was snow on the ground.\n\nAnd there was snow on top of the mountains.\n\n \n\nThe Moose came walking over to him very slowly. \n\n \u201cOhhhh\u2026Hello,\u201d said the moose.\n\n\u201cBundle up, nighttime is coming.\u201d\n\n \n\n \n\nThe cricket did not listen, because crickets do whatever they want.\n\nHe flew up into a pine tree to settle in for a good sleep. He did this quickly because he is such an incredibly fast and fancy flier.\n\n \n\nThe Owl came flying over to the same branch.\n\n\u201cYou should find some shelter from the cold night,\u201d said the owl.\n\n \n\nThe cricket did not listen, because crickets do whatever they want.\n\n \n\nHe decided to rest on a pile of twigs. He was sleepier than he had ever been, from all the remarkably fast and fancy flying.\n\n \n\nThe cricket slept all through the night until morning.\n\nWhen he woke up he was ready to go home and tell the ant about his trip.\n\nHe hopped high in the air to start flying, but he couldn\u2019t. Instead he fell right back into the snow. He hopped again, even higher this time, but his wings would not work. They had frozen solid during the cold night.\n\n \n\n \n\nHe tried to warm them up by rubbing them together but it was no use. \n\nThe cricket had to hop all the way home. It took him days and days to return. \n \n\n \n\nBy the time he got back, his wings had almost become unfrozen.\n\nWhen he rubbed them together this time, they made a chirping noise that no one in the forest had ever heard before. And every time he rubbed his wings together they chirped a little bit louder and got a little less frozen.\n\n \n\nBut it is important to know, dear reader, that wings are special and fragile things. This is why the greatest care should always be taken around them. They are not meant to be frozen, and once they are, they may never be the same again.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEven though the cricket\u2019s wings were no longer frozen, he still could not fly. And ever since then the cricket stays on the ground like his friend the ant, and hops from place to place. And now the cricket is the fastest and fanciest hopper there is.\n\n \n\nAt nighttime, you can hear him chirping, from rubbing his wings together to keep warm.\n\nBut he is doing much more than just that\u2026\n\n \n\nThe cricket is telling you how warm or cold it is by chirping. He chirps faster when it is warm, and slower when it is cold. This way, you will not make the same mistake that he did. However, that is only if you decide to listen\u2026\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n*Dolbear\u2019s Law states that if you count the number of time a cricket chirps in 15 seconds, and add 40, it will give you (roughly) the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

He simply refused!\n\n \n\n \n\nThe king got more gifts, never peaking inside,\n\nWhile the duck waited patiently, by the King\u2019s side.\n\n \n\nUntil, with a laugh, Michael spoke to a friend,\n\n\u201cI wish, how I wish, that this night would not end!\u201d\n\n \n\nWhen you wish for a wish, you must mind every word,\n\nFor a magic-wish duck is a powerful bird\u2026\n\n \n\nThe duck\u2019s magic beak turned from golden to blue.\n\nThe wish had been granted, so off the duck flew.\n\n \n\nAs wishes had been, this was one of the worst.\n\nFrom that moment on, the poor kingdom was cursed.\n\n \n\nWith morning came darkness, no warmth and no sun.\n\nThe night would not leave, for the damage was done.\n\n \n\nEach morning King Michael had hoped to see light.\n\nWhile the crops withered slowly, in shadow of night.\n\n \n\nThe King offered rubies and emeralds galore,\n\nTo the knight who would bring the old man to his door.\n\n \n\nThe hunters went forth on a duck-finding quest.\n\nUntil both were captured, the king would not rest.\n\n\n\nBut no one had seen the duck\u2019s gold-colored beak,\n\nAnd the search for the man went on week after week.\n\n \n\nOff in the forest, a small cabin stood.\n\nThe old man had built it with amber black wood.\n\n \n\nFor he was a wizard, named \u201cSonto the Bad\u201d,\n\nWho\u2019d been banished by Robert, good King Michael\u2019s dad.\n\n \n\nBy Sonto\u2019s side, sat his duck and a box,\n\nA box with a trio of tri-colored locks.\n\n \n\nInside of the box, Sonto locked up the sun.\n\nAnd magic, just magic, could make this undone.\n \n\nWeeks became months, and the sun never shone.\n\nThe peasants were angry and started to groan.\n\n \n\nFinally, Michael could take it no more.\n\nHe would go fix things and settle this score!\n\n \n\nSo rarely did Kings travel solo by horse,\n\nBut Michael charged on, and he stayed on his course.\n\n \n\nThe council had urged him that east would be best,\n\nBut the King disagreed, and rode off to the west.\n\n \n\nThe road was not safe, filled with perilous foes,\n\nLike armies of warthogs and red forest trolls.\n\n \n\nHe battled these creatures without any fear,\n\nIn brave, kingly ways that are not mentioned here.\n\n \n\nOne evening the King paused to look at his map,\n\nAnd somehow, instead, he slipped into a nap.\n\n \n\nHe slept rather soundly on leaf-covered ground,\n\nAnd awoke from his dream when he heard a loud sound.\n\n \n\nWhen he looked round a tree, Michael spotted the source.\n\n\u201cA cabin!\u201d he whispered, and tied up his horse.\n\n \n\nUp to the window, he creeped and he crept.\n\nWhen he saw the old wizard, he cheered and he lept!\n\n \n\n\u201cI found you!\u201d he shouted, and burst through the door.\n\n(Though a king should know better than manners so poor).\n\n \n\nHe insisted the wizard reverse what he\u2019d done,\n\nThen he took back his wish and demanded the sun.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather eat wormtoads than do what you say,\n\nBut I offer you this, a small game we can play.\n\n \n\nInside of this box lies the magic you seek.\u201d\n\nSonto grinned wide and continued to speak.\n\n \n\n\u201cThree keys for three locks, are the only way in.\n\nAnswer three riddles, unlock them and win.\n\n\n\nBut if you should fail, or not answer in time,\n\nYour title is forfeit, your kingdom is mine!\u201d\n\n \n\nA king must be wise to rule over a nation,\n\nSo, Michael was ready, without hesitation.\n\n \n\nThey both took a seat, and the duck gave a glare.\n\n(The King, without knowing, had taken his chair).\n\n \n\nThe box was between them, it sat in the middle.\n\nSonto spoke first, to recite the first riddle.\n\n \n\n\u201cI climb up a hill and reach out to the sky,\n\nAnd still you are taller- I ask, who am I?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAn ant,\u201d said the king, as the old wizard frowned\n\n\u201cWhose hill only sits but an inch off the ground.\u201d\n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cSonto the Bad\u201d muttered, \u201cWell\u2026lucky guess.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how you handle the riddle up next.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing as large, not on land or at sea,\n\nBut you won\u2019t feel my weight, when you rest under me\u201d\n\n \n\nThe King answered back with the promptest reply,\n\n\u201cEnormous and weightless, you must be the sky.\u201d\n\n \n\nSonto was mad, he did not like to lose.\n\nFor last of his riddles, he knew which to choose.\n\nThe answers to all three riddles can be found in this picture\u2026\nThe answers to all three riddles can be found in this picture\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m older than all, and although this is true,\n\nSomehow I\u2019ve seen fewer nights than have you.\u201d\n\n \n\nSonto laughed out as he watched the King think,\n\nUntil the good King gave a smile and wink\u2026\n\n \n\n\u201cThe riddle is solved, and the game has been won.\n\nYou never see night, because you are the sun!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe box opened up and a small ball of light,\n\nShot through the ceiling and took off in flight\n\n \n\nIt grew as it rose in a wonderful way,\n\n\u2019Til the sun filled the sky and changed night into day!\n\n \n\nAt the castle the King had a great celebration\n\nWith no gifts allowed, only pure jubilation.\n\n \n\nThe wizard was jailed for his mischievous crime,\n\nBut the king let him out after one day of time.\n\n\n\nHe was ordered to clean by decree of the Queen,\n\nLook after the horses, and mop the floors clean.\n\n \n\nWhen Michael walked by, he was greeted by cheers.\n\nThey spoke of his greatness for years upon years.\n\n \n\nHowever, the duck, was not heard from again\n\nThe closest they found was an unpleasant hen.\n\n \n\nIf you see him, this duck, with his colorful beak,\n\nI warn you, be wary, of that
