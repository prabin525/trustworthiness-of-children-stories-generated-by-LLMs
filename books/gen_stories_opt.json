Don't turn your\nfeet inwards; a well-educated Duckling always keeps his legs far apart,\nlike his father and mother, just so--look! Now bow your necks, and say,\n'Quack.'\"\n\nAnd they did as they were told. But the other Ducks, who were in the\nyard, looked at them and said aloud, \"Just see! Now we have another\nbrood, as if there were not enough of us already. And fie! how ugly\nthat one is. We will not endure it.\" And immediately one of the Ducks\nflew at him, and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" said the mother. \"He is doing no one any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so large and so strange-looking, and therefore he shall\nbe teased,\" said the others.\n\n\"Those are fine children that our good mother has,\" said the old Duck\nwith the red rag on her leg. \"All are pretty except one, and that has\nnot turned out well; I almost wish it could be hatched over again.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, please your Highness,\" said the mother. \"Certainly he\nis not handsome, but he is a very good child, and swims as well as the\nothers, indeed, rather better. I think he will grow like the others all\nin good time, and perhaps will look smaller. He stayed so long in the\negg-shell, that is the cause of the difference.\" And she scratched the\nDuckling's neck, and stroked his whole body. \"Besides,\" added she, \"he\nis a Drake. I think he will be very strong, so it does not matter so\nmuch. He will fight his way through.\"\n\n\"The other Ducks are very pretty,\" said the old Duck. \"Pray make\nyourselves at home, and if you find an eel's head you can bring it\nto me.\"\n\nSo they made themselves at home.\n\nBut the poor little Duckling, who had come last out of its egg-shell,\nand who was so ugly, was bitten, pecked, and teased by both Ducks and\nHens. \"It is so large!\" said they all. And the Turkey-cock, who had come\ninto the world with spurs on, and therefore fancied he was an emperor,\npuffed himself up like a ship in full sail, and marched up to the\nDuckling quite red with passion. The poor little thing scarcely knew\nwhat to do. He was quite distressed, because he was so ugly, and\nbecause he was the jest of the poultry-yard.\n\nSo passed the first day, and afterwards matters grew worse and\nworse--the poor Duckling was scorned by all. Even his brothers and\nsisters behaved unkindly, and were constantly saying, \"May the Cat take\nyou, you nasty creature!\" The mother said, \"Ah, if you were only far\naway!\" The Ducks bit him, the Hens pecked him, and the girl who fed the\npoultry kicked him.\n\nHe ran through the hedge, and the little birds in the bushes were\nterrified. \"That is because I am so ugly,\" thought the Duckling,\nshutting his eyes, but he ran on. At last he came to a wide moor,\nwhere lived some Wild Ducks; here he lay the whole night, very tired\nand comfortless. In the morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and saw their\nnew companion. \"Pray who are you?\" asked they; and our little Duckling\nturned himself in all directions, and greeted them as politely as\npossible.\n\n\"You are really uncommonly ugly!\" said the Wild Ducks. \"However, that\ndoes not matter to us, provided you do not marry into our families.\"\nPoor thing! he had never thought of marrying; he only begged permission\nto lie among the reeds, and drink the water of the moor.\n\nThere he lay for two whole days. On the third day there came two Wild\nGeese, or rather Ganders, who had not been long out of their egg-shells,\nwhich accounts for their impertinence.\n\n\"Hark ye,\" said they; \"you are so ugly that we like you very well. Will\nyou come with us and be a bird of passage? On another moor, not far\nfrom this, are some dear, sweet Wild Geese, as lovely creatures as have\never said 'Hiss, hiss.' You are truly in the way to make your fortune,\nugly as you are.\"\n\nBang! a gun went off all at once, and both Wild Geese were stretched\ndead among the reeds; the water became red with blood. Bang! a gun went\noff again. Whole flocks of Wild Geese flew up from among the reeds, and\nanother report followed.\n\nThere was a grand hunting party. The hunters lay in ambush all around;\nsome were even sitting in the trees, whose huge branches stretched far\nover the moor. The blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist,\nand was dispersed as it fell over the water. The hounds splashed about\nin the mud, the reeds and rushes bent in all directions.\n\nHow frightened the poor little Duck was! He turned his head, thinking\nto hide it under his wings, and in a moment a most formidable-looking\nDog stood close to him, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes\nsparkling fearfully. He opened wide his jaws at the sight of our\nDuckling, showing him his sharp white teeth, and, splash, splash!\nhe was gone--gone without hurting him:", "prompt": "</s>It was beautiful in the country.

Plump she went into the water. \"Quack! quack!\" cried she, and one\nduckling after another jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but\nall came up again, and swam together quite easily. Their legs moved\nwithout effort. All were there, even the ugly grey one.\n\n\"No; it is not a turkey,\" said the old Duck; \"only see how prettily it\nmoves its legs, how upright it holds itself! It is my own child. It is\nalso really very pretty, when you look more closely at it. Quack! quack!\nnow come with me, I will take you into the world and introduce you in\nthe duck-yards. But keep close to me, or someone may tread on you; and\nbeware of the Cat.\"\n\nSo they came into the duck-yard. There was a horrid noise; two families\nwere quarreling about the head of an eel, which in the end was carried\noff by the Cat.\n\n\"See, my children, such is the way of the world,\" said the Mother Duck,\nwiping her beak, for she, too, was fond of eels. \"Now use your legs,\"\nsaid she, \"keep together, and bow to the old Duck you see yonder. She\nis the most distinguished of all the fowls present, and is of Spanish\nblood, which accounts for her dignified appearance and manners. And\nlook, she has a red rag on her leg! That is considered extremely\nhandsome, and is the greatest honor a Duck can have. Don't turn your\nfeet inwards; a well-educated Duckling always keeps his legs far apart,\nlike his father and mother, just so--look! Now bow your necks, and say,\n'Quack.'\"\n\nAnd they did as they were told. But the other Ducks, who were in the\nyard, looked at them and said aloud, \"Just see! Now we have another\nbrood, as if there were not enough of us already. And fie! how ugly\nthat one is. We will not endure it.\" And immediately one of the Ducks\nflew at him, and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" said the mother. \"He is doing no one any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so large and so strange-looking, and therefore he shall\nbe teased,\" said the others.\n\n\"Those are fine children that our good mother has,\" said the old Duck\nwith the red rag on her leg. \"All are pretty except one, and that has\nnot turned out well; I almost wish it could be hatched over again.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, please your Highness,\" said the mother. \"Certainly he\nis not handsome, but he is a very good child, and swims as well as the\nothers, indeed, rather better. I think he will grow like the others all\nin good time, and perhaps will look smaller. He stayed so long in the\negg-shell, that is the cause of the difference.\" And she scratched the\nDuckling's neck, and stroked his whole body. \"Besides,\" added she, \"he\nis a Drake. I think he will be very strong, so it does not matter so\nmuch. He will fight his way through.\"\n\n\"The other Ducks are very pretty,\" said the old Duck. \"Pray make\nyourselves at home, and if you find an eel's head you can bring it\nto me.\"\n\nSo they made themselves at home.\n\nBut the poor little Duckling, who had come last out of its egg-shell,\nand who was so ugly, was bitten, pecked, and teased by both Ducks and\nHens. \"It is so large!\" said they all. And the Turkey-cock, who had come\ninto the world with spurs on, and therefore fancied he was an emperor,\npuffed himself up like a ship in full sail, and marched up to the\nDuckling quite red with passion. The poor little thing scarcely knew\nwhat to do. He was quite distressed, because he was so ugly, and\nbecause he was the jest of the poultry-yard.\n\nSo passed the first day, and afterwards matters grew worse and\nworse--the poor Duckling was scorned by all. Even his brothers and\nsisters behaved unkindly, and were constantly saying, \"May the Cat take\nyou, you nasty creature!\" The mother said, \"Ah, if you were only far\naway!\" The Ducks bit him, the Hens pecked him, and the girl who fed the\npoultry kicked him.\n\nHe ran through the hedge, and the little birds in the bushes were\nterrified. \"That is because I am so ugly,\" thought the Duckling,\nshutting his eyes, but he ran on. At last he came to a wide moor,\nwhere lived some Wild Ducks; here he lay the whole night, very tired\nand comfortless. In the morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and saw their\nnew companion. \"Pray who are you?\" asked they; and our little Duckling\nturned himself in all directions, and greeted them as politely as\npossible.\n\n\"You are really uncommonly ugly!\" said the Wild Ducks. \"However, that\ndoes not matter to us, provided you do not marry into our families.\"\nPoor thing! he had never thought of marrying; he only begged permission\nto lie among the reeds, and drink the water of the moor.\n\nThere he lay for two whole days. On the third day there came two Wild\nGeese, or rather Ganders, who had not been long out of their egg-shells,\nwhich accounts for their impertinence.\n\n\"Hark ye,\" said they; \"you are so ugly that we like you very well. Will\nyou come with us and be a bird of passage? On another moor, not far\nfrom this, are some dear, sweet Wild Geese, as lovely creatures as have\never said 'Hiss, hiss.' You are truly in the way to make your fortune,\nugly as you are.\"\n\nBang! a gun went off all at once, and both Wild Geese were stretched\ndead among the reeds; the water became red with blood. Bang! a gun went\noff again. Whole flocks of Wild Geese flew up from among the reeds, and\nanother report followed.\n\nThere was a grand hunting party. The hunters lay in ambush all around;\nsome were even sitting in the trees, whose huge branches stretched far\nover the moor. The blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist,\nand was dispersed as it fell over the water. The hounds splashed about\nin the mud, the reeds and rushes bent in all directions.\n\nHow frightened the poor little Duck was! He turned his head, thinking\nto hide it under his wings, and in a moment a most formidable-looking\nDog stood close to him, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes\nsparkling fearfully. He opened wide his jaws at the sight of our\nDuckling, showing him his sharp white teeth, and, splash, splash!\nhe was gone--gone without hurting him"}, {"id": 1, "gen_id": 0, "p_length": "first_line", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts.\nTheYouIIWhatItThisIIMyItYouMyMyThisItThatIWhatIAIYouInIIIYouIWhatBItIIfTheWhatTMyIWeILWeTItIIYouIIWhatThe\"*MyHowYouIYouYou\nAI\nMyItWhatII\nIIAWhatIYouWhatIIIIThis\n(I*IThisThe\"This\n(TheTheI\n\n((\nI\n\n*\nI\nIIIThe\n\n/\nMy\n\n\nAThe\n\n\nIThe\n\"IITheItMy(\n\n\n/\n\n\nThe\n\nI\nThe\nII\n\n\nThe\nThe\n\n\n\nHow\n/\nA\n\n\nThe\n\n\n\nI/\n\n\n\nThis\n\n\n\n\nThe\"\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n/\n\n\n\n\nWhat\n\n\n*\n-/\nThe(The\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIThe\n(\n\nA\nThe(/\nThe\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nDThis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nThis\n\nD\n\n*\n\nA\n\n\nO\nI\n\n.\n.This/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis\n1\n\n(\nThe\n\n\n\nA/The\n\"", "prompt": "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts."}, {"id": 1, "gen_id": 1, "p_length": "10_percentage", "model_name": "opt", "gen_text": "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts.

If so, we will keep you here, and you\nshall want for nothing.\"\n\nAnd Snow-White answered, \"Yes, with all my heart and will.\" And so she\nremained with them, and kept their house in order.\n\nIn the morning the Dwarfs went into the mountains and searched for\nsilver and gold, and in the evening they came home and found their meals\nready for them.

So she dyed her face and clothed herself as\na pedler woman, so that no one could recognize her, and in this disguise\nshe went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs. She\nknocked at the door of the hut, and called out, \"Fine goods for sale!\nbeautiful goods for sale!\"\n\nSnow-White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my good woman;\nwhat have you to sell?\"\n\n\"Fine goods, beautiful goods!\" she replied. \"Stays of all colors.\" And\nshe held up a pair which were made of many-colored silks.\n\n\"I may let in this honest woman,\" thought Snow-White; and she unbolted\nthe door and bargained for one pair of stays.\n\n\"You can't think, my dear, how they become you!\" exclaimed the old\nwoman. \"Come, let me lace them up for you.\"\n\nSnow-White suspected nothing, and let her do as she wished, but the old\nwoman laced her up so great", "prompt": "</s>Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts.

When the Queen now asked her\nmirror:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is the fairest, now, they say.\"\n\nThis answer so angered the Queen that she became quite yellow with envy.\nFrom that hour, whenever she saw Snow-White, her heart was hardened\nagainst her, and she hated the little girl. Her envy and jealousy\nincreased so that she had no rest day or night, and she said to a\nHuntsman, \"Take the child away into the forest. I will never look\nupon her again. You must kill her, and bring me her heart and tongue\nfor a token.\"\n\nThe Huntsman listened and took the maiden away, but when he drew out his\nknife to kill her, she began to cry, saying, \"Ah, dear Huntsman, give me\nmy life! I will run into the wild forest, and never come home again.\"\n\nThis speech softened the Hunter's heart, and her beauty so touched him\nthat he had pity on her and said, \"Well, run away then, poor child.\" But\nhe thought to himself, \"The wild beasts will soon devour you.\" Still he\nfelt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart, because her death was\nnot by his hand. Just at that moment a young boar came roaring along to\nthe spot, and as soon as he clapped eyes upon it the Huntsman caught it,\nand, killing it, took its tongue and heart and carried them to the\nQueen, for a token of his deed.\n\nBut now poor little Snow-White was left motherless and alone, and\novercome with grief, she was bewildered at the sight of so many trees,\nand knew not which way to turn. She ran till her feet refused to go\nfarther, and as it was getting dark, and she saw a little house near,\nshe entered in to rest. In this cottage everything was very small, but\nvery neat and elegant. In the middle stood a little table with a white\ncloth over it, and seven little plates upon it, each plate having a\nspoon and a knife and a fork, and there were also seven little mugs.\nAgainst the wall were seven little beds arranged in a row, each covered\nwith snow-white sheets.\n\nLittle Snow-White, being both hungry and thirsty, ate a little morsel of\nporridge out of each plate, and drank a drop or two of wine out of each\nmug, for she did not wish to take away the whole share of anyone. After\nthat, because she was so tired, she laid herself down on one bed, but it\ndid not suit; she tried another, but that was too long; a fourth was too\nshort, a fifth too hard. But the seventh was just the thing; and\ntucking herself up in it, she went to sleep, first saying her prayers\nas usual.\n\nWhen it became quite dark the owners of the cottage came home, seven\nDwarfs, who dug for gold and silver in the mountains. They first\nlighted seven little lamps, and saw at once--for they lit up the whole\nroom--that somebody had been in, for everything was not in the order in\nwhich they had left it.\n\nThe first asked, \"Who has been sitting on my chair?\" The second, \"Who\nhas been eating off my plate?\" The third said, \"Who has been nibbling\nat my bread?\" The fourth, \"Who has been at my porridge?\" The fifth,\n\"Who has been meddling with my fork?\" The sixth grumbled out, \"Who has\nbeen cutting with my knife?\" The seventh said, \"Who has been drinking\nout of my mug?\"\n\nThen the first, looking round, began again, \"Who has been lying on my\nbed?\" he asked, for he saw that the sheets were tumbled. At these words\nthe others came, and looking at their beds cried out too, \"Some one has\nbeen lying in our beds!\" But the seventh little man, running up to his,\nsaw Snow-White sleeping in it; so he called his companions, who shouted\nwith wonder and held up their seven lamps, so that the light fell upon\nthe little girl.\n\n\"Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!\" said they; \"what a beauty she is!\" and they\nwere so much delighted that they would not awaken her, but left her to\nsleep, and the seventh Dwarf, in whose bed she was, slept with each of\nhis fellows one hour, and so passed the night.\n\nAs soon as morning dawned Snow-White awoke, and was quite frightened\nwhen she saw the seven little men; but they were very friendly, and\nasked her what she was called.\n\n\"My name is Snow-White,\" was her reply.\n\n\"Why have you come into our cottage?\" they asked.\n\nThen she told them how her stepmother would have had her killed, but the\nHuntsman had spared her life, and how she had wandered about the Whole\nday until at last she had found their house.\n\nWhen her tale was finished the Dwarfs said, \"Will you look after our\nhousehold--be our cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit for us, and\nkeep everything in neat order? If so, we will keep you here, and you\nshall want for nothing.\"\n\nAnd Snow-White answered, \"Yes, with all my heart and will.\" And so she\nremained with them, and kept their house in order.\n\nIn the morning the Dwarfs went into the mountains and searched for\nsilver and gold, and in the evening they came home and found their meals\nready for them. During the day the maiden was left alone, and therefore\nthe good Dwarfs warned her and said, \"Be careful of your stepmother, who\nwill soon know of your being here. So let nobody enter the cottage.\"\n\nThe Queen meanwhile, supposing that she had eaten the heart and tongue\nof her stepdaughter, believed that she was now above all the most\nbeautiful woman in the world. One day she stepped before her mirror,\nand said:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is fairest now, they say.\n     The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway\n     Amid the forest, far away.\"\n\nThis reply surprised her, but she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.\nShe knew, therefore, that the Huntsman had deceived her, and that\nSnow-White was still alive. So she dyed her face and clothed herself as\na pedler woman, so that no one could recognize her, and in this disguise\nshe went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs. She\nknocked at the door of the hut, and called out, \"Fine goods for sale!\nbeautiful goods for sale!\"\n\nSnow-White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my good woman;\nwhat have you to sell?\"\n\n\"Fine goods, beautiful goods!\" she replied. \"Stays of all colors.\" And\nshe held up a pair which were made of many-colored silks.\n\n\"I may let in this honest woman,\" thought Snow-White; and she unbolted\nthe door and bargained for one pair of stays.\n\n\"You can't think, my dear, how they become you!\" exclaimed the old\nwoman. \"Come, let me lace them up for you.\"\n\nSnow-White suspected nothing, and let her do as she wished, but the old\nwoman laced her up so"}]
