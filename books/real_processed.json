[{"id": 0, "text": "ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.\n\u201cYou will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,\u201d she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.\n\u201cWhat disobedient children!\u201d cried the old Water-rat; \u201cthey really deserve to be drowned.\u201d\n\u201cNothing of the kind,\u201d answered the Duck, \u201cevery one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.\u201d\n\u201cAh! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,\u201d said the Water-rat; \u201cI am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?\u201d asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.\n\u201cYes, that is just what I want to know,\u201d said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.\n\u201cWhat a silly question!\u201d cried the Water-rat.  \u201cI should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would you do in return?\u201d said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d answered the Water-rat.\n\u201cLet me tell you a story on the subject,\u201d said the Linnet.\n\u201cIs the story about me?\u201d asked the Water-rat.  \u201cIf so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.\u201d\n\u201cIt is applicable to you,\u201d answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d said the Linnet, \u201cthere was an honest little fellow named Hans.\u201d\n\u201cWas he very distinguished?\u201d asked the Water-rat.\n\u201cNo,\u201d answered the Linnet, \u201cI don\u2019t think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds\u2019-purses, and Fair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower\u2019s place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\u201cLittle Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\u201c\u2018Real friends should have everything in common,\u2019 the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.\n\u201cSometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship.\n\u201cSo little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\u201c\u2018There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,\u2019 the Miller used to say to his wife, \u2018for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018You are certainly very thoughtful about others,\u2019 answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; \u2018very thoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018But could we not ask little Hans up here?\u2019 said the Miller\u2019s youngest son.  \u2018If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018What a silly boy you are!\u2019 cried the Miller; \u2018I really don\u2019t know what is the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody\u2019s nature.  I certainly will not allow Hans\u2019 nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can see that.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018How well you talk!\u2019 said the Miller\u2019s Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; \u2018really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in church.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Lots of people act well,\u2019 answered the Miller; \u2018but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also\u2019; and he looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.\u201d\n\u201cIs that the end of the story?\u201d asked the Water-rat.\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d answered the Linnet, \u201cthat is the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cThen you are quite behind the age,\u201d said the Water-rat.  \u201cEvery good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered \u2018Pooh!\u2019\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, \u201cas soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans.\n\u201c\u2018Why, what a good heart you have!\u2019 cried his Wife; \u2018you are always thinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.\u2019\n\u201cSo the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\u201c\u2018Good morning, little Hans,\u2019 said the Miller.\n\u201c\u2018Good morning,\u2019 said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear.\n\u201c\u2018And how have you been all the winter?\u2019 said the Miller.\n\u201c\u2018Well, really,\u2019 cried Hans, \u2018it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018and wondered how you were getting on.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018That was kind of you,\u2019 said Hans; \u2018I was half afraid you had forgotten me.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Hans, I am surprised at you,\u2019 said the Miller; \u2018friendship never forgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don\u2019t understand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!\u201d\n\u201c\u2018They are certainly very lovely,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster\u2019s daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don\u2019t mean to say you have sold it?\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, the fact is,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018that I was obliged to.  You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Hans,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, that is generous of you,\u2019 said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.  \u2018I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018A plank of wood!\u2019 said the Miller; \u2018why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don\u2019t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.\n\u201c\u2018It is not a very big plank,\u2019 said the Miller, looking at it, \u2018and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won\u2019t be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Quite full?\u2019 said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.\n\u201c\u2018Well, really,\u2019 answered the Miller, \u2018as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don\u2019t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018My dear friend, my best friend,\u2019 cried little Hans, \u2018you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day\u2019; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller\u2019s basket.\n\u201c\u2018Good-bye, little Hans,\u2019 said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\u201c\u2018Good-bye,\u2019 said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\u201cThe next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller\u2019s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\u201cThere was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\u201c\u2018Dear little Hans,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so sorry,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018but I am really very busy to-day.  I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, really,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Oh, don\u2019t say that,\u2019 cried little Hans, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be unfriendly for the whole world\u2019; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders.\n\u201cIt was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\u201c\u2018It has certainly been a hard day,\u2019 said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, \u2018but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.\u2019\n\u201cEarly the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\u201c\u2018Upon my word,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018you are very lazy.  Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don\u2019t like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018I am very sorry,\u2019 said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, \u2018but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, I am glad of that,\u2019 said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, \u2018for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.\u2019\n\u201cPoor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\u201c\u2018Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?\u2019 he inquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\u201c\u2018Well, really,\u2019 answered the Miller, \u2018I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Oh! on no account,\u2019 cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\u201cHe worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on.\n\u201c\u2018Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?\u2019 cried the Miller in a cheery voice.\n\u201c\u2018It is quite mended,\u2019 answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,\u2019 answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, \u2018a very great privilege.\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Oh! they will come to you,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018but you must take more pains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Do you really think I shall?\u2019 asked little Hans.\n\u201c\u2018I have no doubt of it,\u2019 answered the Miller, \u2018but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.\u2019\n\u201cPoor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\u201c\u2018What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,\u2019 he said, and he went to work at once.\n\u201cBut somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.  \u2018Besides,\u2019 he used to say, \u2018he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.\u2019\n\u201cSo little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.\n\u201cNow it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.\n\u201c\u2018It is some poor traveller,\u2019 said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.\n\u201cThere stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.\n\u201c\u2018Dear little Hans,\u2019 cried the Miller, \u2018I am in great trouble.  My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 cried little Hans, \u2018I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018I am very sorry,\u2019 answered the Miller, \u2018but it is my new lantern, and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Well, never mind, I will do without it,\u2019 cried little Hans, and he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off.\n\u201cWhat a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor\u2019s house, and knocked at the door.\n\u201c\u2018Who is there?\u2019 cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window.\n\u201c\u2018Little Hans, Doctor.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019What do you want, little Hans?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018The Miller\u2019s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018All right!\u2019 said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller\u2019s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\u201cBut the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\u201cEverybody went to little Hans\u2019 funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.\n\u201c\u2018As I was his best friend,\u2019 said the Miller, \u2018it is only fair that I should have the best place\u2019; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.\n\u201c\u2018Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,\u2019 said the Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\u201c\u2018A great loss to me at any rate,\u2019 answered the Miller; \u2018why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don\u2019t know what to do with it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take care not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being generous.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\u201cWell, that is the end,\u201d said the Linnet.\n\u201cBut what became of the Miller?\u201d asked the Water-rat.\n\u201cOh!  I really don\u2019t know,\u201d replied the Linnet; \u201cand I am sure that I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cIt is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,\u201d said the Water-rat.\n\u201cI am afraid you don\u2019t quite see the moral of the story,\u201d remarked the Linnet.\n\u201cThe what?\u201d screamed the Water-rat.\n\u201cThe moral.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to say that the story has a moral?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said the Linnet.\n\u201cWell, really,\u201d said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, \u201cI think you should have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said \u2018Pooh,\u2019 like the critic.  However, I can say it now\u201d; so he shouted out \u201cPooh\u201d at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.\n\u201cAnd how do you like the Water-rat?\u201d asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards.  \u201cHe has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother\u2019s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,\u201d answered the Linnet.  \u201cThe fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.\u201d\n\u201cAh! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,\u201d said the Duck.\nAnd I quite agree with her.", "title": "THE DEVOTED FRIEND\n"}, {"id": 1, "text": "EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant\u2019s garden.\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.  \u201cHow happy we are here!\u201d they cried to each other.\nOne day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.\n\u201cMy own garden is my own garden,\u201d said the Giant; \u201cany one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\u201d  So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\n          TRESPASSERS \n            WILL BE \n           PROSECUTED \nHe was a very selfish Giant.\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  \u201cHow happy we were there,\u201d they said to each other.\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.\n\u201cSpring has forgotten this garden,\u201d they cried, \u201cso we will live here all the year round.\u201d  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.\n\u201cThis is a delightful spot,\u201d he said, \u201cwe must ask the Hail on a visit.\u201d\nSo the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.\n\u201cI cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,\u201d said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; \u201cI hope there will be a change in the weather.\u201d\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant\u2019s garden she gave none.  \u201cHe is too selfish,\u201d she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King\u2019s musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.  \u201cI believe the Spring has come at last,\u201d said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.\nWhat did he see?\nHe saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children\u2019s heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.\nIt was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.  \u201cClimb up! little boy,\u201d said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\nAnd the Giant\u2019s heart melted as he looked out.  \u201cHow selfish I have been!\u201d he said; \u201cnow I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children\u2019s playground for ever and ever.\u201d  He was really very sorry for what he had done.\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.\nOnly the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant\u2019s neck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.  \u201cIt is your garden now, little children,\u201d said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people were going to market at twelve o\u2019clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.\n\u201cBut where is your little companion?\u201d he said: \u201cthe boy I put into the tree.\u201d  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d answered the children; \u201che has gone away.\u201d\n\u201cYou must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,\u201d said the Giant.\nBut the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.\nThe Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.  \u201cHow I would like to see him!\u201d he used to say.\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.  \u201cI have many beautiful flowers,\u201d he said; \u201cbut the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.\u201d\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It certainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, \u201cWho hath dared to wound thee?\u201d  For on the palms of the child\u2019s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\n\u201cWho hath dared to wound thee?\u201d cried the Giant; \u201ctell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.\u201d\n\u201cNay!\u201d answered the child; \u201cbut these are the wounds of Love.\u201d\n\u201cWho art thou?\u201d said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, \u201cYou let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.\u201d\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.", "title": "THE SELFISH GIANT\n"}, {"id": 2, "text": "It was beautiful in the country. It was summertime. The wheat was\nyellow, the oats were green, the hay was stacked up in the green\nmeadows, and the stork paraded about on his long red legs, talking\nin Egyptian, which language he had learnt from his mother.\n\nThe fields and meadows were skirted by thick woods, and a deep lake lay\nin the midst of the woods. Yes; it was indeed beautiful in the country!\nThe sunshine fell warmly on an old mansion, surrounded by deep canals,\nand from the walls down to the water's edge there grew large burdock\nleaves, so high that children could stand upright among them without\nbeing seen.\n\nThis place was as wild as the thickest part of the wood, and on that\naccount a Duck had chosen to make her nest there. She was sitting on\nher eggs; but the pleasure she had felt at first was now almost gone,\nbecause she had been there so long, and had so few visitors, for the\nother Ducks preferred swimming on the canals to sitting among the\nburdock leaves gossiping with her.\n\nAt last the eggs cracked one after another, \"Chick, chick!\" All the eggs\nwere alive, and one little head after another peered forth. \"Quack,\nquack!\" said the Duck, and all got up as well as they could. They peeped\nabout from under the green leaves; and as green is good for the eyes,\ntheir mother let them look as long as they pleased.\n\n\"How large the world is!\" said the little ones, for they found their new\nabode very different from their former narrow one in the egg-shells.\n\n\"Do you imagine this to be the whole of the world?\" said the mother.\n\"It extends far beyond the other side of the garden in the pastor's\nfield; but I have never been there. Are you all here?\" And then she got\nup. \"No, not all, for the largest egg is still here. How long will this\nlast? I am so weary of it!\" And then she sat down again.\n\n\"Well, and how are you getting on?\" asked an old Duck, who had come to\npay her a visit.\n\n\"This one egg keeps me so long,\" said the mother. \"It will not break.\nBut you should see the others! They are the prettiest little Ducklings\nI have seen in all my days. They are all like their father--the\ngood-for-nothing fellow, he has not been to visit me once!\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the old Duck. \"Depend\nupon it, it is a turkey's egg. I was cheated in the same way once\nmyself, and I had such trouble with the young ones; for they were afraid\nof the water, and I could not get them there. I called and scolded, but\nit was all of no use. But let me see the egg--ah, yes! to be sure, that\nis a turkey's egg. Leave it, and teach the other little ones to swim.\"\n\n\"What is the Matter?\" asked the Old Woman]\n\n\"I will sit on it a little longer,\" said the Duck. \"I have been sitting\nso long, that I may as well spend the harvest here.\"\n\n\"It is no business of mine,\" said the old Duck, and away she waddled.\n\nThe great egg burst at last. \"Chick! chick!\" said the little one, and\nout it tumbled--but, oh! how large and ugly it was! The Duck looked at\nit. \"That is a great, strong creature,\" said she. \"None of the others\nare at all like it. Can it be a young turkey-cock? Well, we shall soon\nfind out. It must go into the water, though I push it in myself.\"\n\nThe next day there was delightful weather, and the sun shone warmly upon\nthe green leaves when Mother Duck with all her family went down to the\ncanal. Plump she went into the water. \"Quack! quack!\" cried she, and one\nduckling after another jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but\nall came up again, and swam together quite easily. Their legs moved\nwithout effort. All were there, even the ugly grey one.\n\n\"No; it is not a turkey,\" said the old Duck; \"only see how prettily it\nmoves its legs, how upright it holds itself! It is my own child. It is\nalso really very pretty, when you look more closely at it. Quack! quack!\nnow come with me, I will take you into the world and introduce you in\nthe duck-yards. But keep close to me, or someone may tread on you; and\nbeware of the Cat.\"\n\nSo they came into the duck-yard. There was a horrid noise; two families\nwere quarreling about the head of an eel, which in the end was carried\noff by the Cat.\n\n\"See, my children, such is the way of the world,\" said the Mother Duck,\nwiping her beak, for she, too, was fond of eels. \"Now use your legs,\"\nsaid she, \"keep together, and bow to the old Duck you see yonder. She\nis the most distinguished of all the fowls present, and is of Spanish\nblood, which accounts for her dignified appearance and manners. And\nlook, she has a red rag on her leg! That is considered extremely\nhandsome, and is the greatest honor a Duck can have. Don't turn your\nfeet inwards; a well-educated Duckling always keeps his legs far apart,\nlike his father and mother, just so--look! Now bow your necks, and say,\n'Quack.'\"\n\nAnd they did as they were told. But the other Ducks, who were in the\nyard, looked at them and said aloud, \"Just see! Now we have another\nbrood, as if there were not enough of us already. And fie! how ugly\nthat one is. We will not endure it.\" And immediately one of the Ducks\nflew at him, and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" said the mother. \"He is doing no one any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so large and so strange-looking, and therefore he shall\nbe teased,\" said the others.\n\n\"Those are fine children that our good mother has,\" said the old Duck\nwith the red rag on her leg. \"All are pretty except one, and that has\nnot turned out well; I almost wish it could be hatched over again.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, please your Highness,\" said the mother. \"Certainly he\nis not handsome, but he is a very good child, and swims as well as the\nothers, indeed, rather better. I think he will grow like the others all\nin good time, and perhaps will look smaller. He stayed so long in the\negg-shell, that is the cause of the difference.\" And she scratched the\nDuckling's neck, and stroked his whole body. \"Besides,\" added she, \"he\nis a Drake. I think he will be very strong, so it does not matter so\nmuch. He will fight his way through.\"\n\n\"The other Ducks are very pretty,\" said the old Duck. \"Pray make\nyourselves at home, and if you find an eel's head you can bring it\nto me.\"\n\nSo they made themselves at home.\n\nBut the poor little Duckling, who had come last out of its egg-shell,\nand who was so ugly, was bitten, pecked, and teased by both Ducks and\nHens. \"It is so large!\" said they all. And the Turkey-cock, who had come\ninto the world with spurs on, and therefore fancied he was an emperor,\npuffed himself up like a ship in full sail, and marched up to the\nDuckling quite red with passion. The poor little thing scarcely knew\nwhat to do. He was quite distressed, because he was so ugly, and\nbecause he was the jest of the poultry-yard.\n\nSo passed the first day, and afterwards matters grew worse and\nworse--the poor Duckling was scorned by all. Even his brothers and\nsisters behaved unkindly, and were constantly saying, \"May the Cat take\nyou, you nasty creature!\" The mother said, \"Ah, if you were only far\naway!\" The Ducks bit him, the Hens pecked him, and the girl who fed the\npoultry kicked him.\n\nHe ran through the hedge, and the little birds in the bushes were\nterrified. \"That is because I am so ugly,\" thought the Duckling,\nshutting his eyes, but he ran on. At last he came to a wide moor,\nwhere lived some Wild Ducks; here he lay the whole night, very tired\nand comfortless. In the morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and saw their\nnew companion. \"Pray who are you?\" asked they; and our little Duckling\nturned himself in all directions, and greeted them as politely as\npossible.\n\n\"You are really uncommonly ugly!\" said the Wild Ducks. \"However, that\ndoes not matter to us, provided you do not marry into our families.\"\nPoor thing! he had never thought of marrying; he only begged permission\nto lie among the reeds, and drink the water of the moor.\n\nThere he lay for two whole days. On the third day there came two Wild\nGeese, or rather Ganders, who had not been long out of their egg-shells,\nwhich accounts for their impertinence.\n\n\"Hark ye,\" said they; \"you are so ugly that we like you very well. Will\nyou come with us and be a bird of passage? On another moor, not far\nfrom this, are some dear, sweet Wild Geese, as lovely creatures as have\never said 'Hiss, hiss.' You are truly in the way to make your fortune,\nugly as you are.\"\n\nBang! a gun went off all at once, and both Wild Geese were stretched\ndead among the reeds; the water became red with blood. Bang! a gun went\noff again. Whole flocks of Wild Geese flew up from among the reeds, and\nanother report followed.\n\nThere was a grand hunting party. The hunters lay in ambush all around;\nsome were even sitting in the trees, whose huge branches stretched far\nover the moor. The blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist,\nand was dispersed as it fell over the water. The hounds splashed about\nin the mud, the reeds and rushes bent in all directions.\n\nHow frightened the poor little Duck was! He turned his head, thinking\nto hide it under his wings, and in a moment a most formidable-looking\nDog stood close to him, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes\nsparkling fearfully. He opened wide his jaws at the sight of our\nDuckling, showing him his sharp white teeth, and, splash, splash!\nhe was gone--gone without hurting him.\n\n\"Well! let me be thankful,\" sighed he. \"I am so ugly that even the Dog\nwill not eat me.\"\n\nAnd now he lay still, though the shooting continued among the reeds,\nshot following shot.\n\nThe noise did not cease till late in the day, and even then the poor\nlittle thing dared not stir. He waited several hours before he looked\naround him, and then hurried away from the moor as fast as he could.\nHe ran over fields and meadows, though the wind was so high that he\nhad some difficulty in moving.\n\nTowards evening he reached a wretched little hut, so wretched that it\nknew not on which side to fall, and therefore remained standing. The\nwind blew violently, so that our poor little Duckling was obliged to\nsupport himself on his tail, in order to stand against it; but it\nbecame worse and worse. He then noticed that the door had lost one\nof its hinges, and hung so much awry that he could creep through the\ncrack into the room. So he went in.\n\nIn this room lived an old woman, with her Tom-cat and her Hen. The Cat,\nwhom she called her little son, knew how to set up his back and purr;\nindeed, he could even throw out sparks when stroked the wrong way. The\nHen had very short legs, and was therefore called \"Chickie Short-legs.\"\nShe laid very good eggs, and the old woman loved her as her own child.\n\nThe next morning the new guest was discovered, and the Cat began to mew\nand the Hen to cackle.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the old woman, looking round. But her eyes\nwere not good, so she took the young Duckling to be a fat Duck who had\nlost her way. \"This is a capital catch,\" said she, \"I shall now have\nDuck's eggs, if it be not a Drake. We shall see.\"\n\nAnd so the Duckling was kept on trial for three weeks, but no eggs made\ntheir appearance. Now the Cat was the master of the house, and the Hen\nwas the mistress, and always used to say, \"We and the world,\" for they\nimagined themselves to be not only the half of the world, but also by\nfar the better half. The Duckling thought it was possible to be of a\ndifferent opinion, but that the Hen would not allow.\n\n\"Can you lay eggs?\" asked she.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, then, hold your tongue.\"\n\nAnd the Cat said, \"Can you set up your back? Can you purr?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you should have no opinion when reasonable people are\nspeaking.\"\n\nSo the Duckling sat alone in a corner, and felt very miserable. However,\nhe happened to think of the fresh air and bright sunshine, and these\nthoughts gave him such a strong desire to swim again, that he could not\nhelp telling it to the Hen.\n\n\"What ails you?\" said the Hen. \"You have nothing to do, and therefore\nbrood over these fancies. Either lay eggs or purr, then you will forget\nthem.\"\n\n\"But it is so delicious to swim!\" said the Duckling. \"So delicious when\nthe waters close over your head, and you plunge to the bottom!\"\n\n\"Well, that is a queer sort of pleasure,\" said the Hen. \"I think you\nmust be crazy. Not to speak of myself, ask the Cat--he is the most\nsensible animal I know--whether he would like to swim, or to plunge to\nthe bottom of the water. Ask our mistress, the old woman--there is no\none in the world wiser than she. Do you think she would take pleasure\nin swimming and in the waters closing over her head?\"\n\n\"You do not understand me,\" said the Duckling.\n\n\"What! we do not understand you? So you think yourself wiser than the\nCat and the old woman, not to speak of myself? Do not fancy any such\nthing, child; but be thankful for all the kindness that has been shown\nyou. Are you not lodged in a warm room, and have you not the advantage\nof society from which you can learn something? But you are a simpleton,\nand it is wearisome to have anything to do with you. Believe me, I wish\nyou well. I tell you unpleasant truths, but it is thus that real\nfriendship is shown. Come, for once give yourself the trouble to\nlearn to purr, or to lay eggs.\"\n\n\"I think I will go out into the wide world again,\" said the Duckling.\n\n\"Well, go,\" answered the Hen.\n\nSo the Duckling went. He swam on the surface of the water, he plunged\nbeneath, but all animals passed him by, on account of his ugliness. And\nthe autumn came, the leaves turned yellow and brown, the wind caught\nthem and danced them about, the air was very cold, the clouds were heavy\nwith hail or snow, and the Raven sat on the hedge and croaked. The poor\nDuckling was certainly not very comfortable.\n\nOne evening, just as the sun was setting with unusual brilliancy, a\nflock of large, beautiful birds rose from out of the brushwood. The\nDuckling had never seen anything so beautiful before; their plumage was\nof a dazzling white, and they had long, slender necks. They were Swans.\nThey uttered a singular cry, spread out their long splendid wings, and\nflew away from these cold regions to warmer countries, across the open\nsea. They flew so high, so very high! And the little Ugly Duckling's\nfeelings were so strange. He turned round and round in the water like a\nmill-wheel, strained his neck to look after them, and sent forth such a\nloud and strange cry that it almost frightened himself. Ah! he could not\nforget them, those noble birds, those happy birds! When he could see\nthem no longer he plunged to the bottom of the water, and when he rose\nagain was almost beside himself. The Duckling knew not what the birds\nwere called, knew not whither they were flying; yet he loved them as he\nhad never before loved anything. He envied them not; it would never have\noccurred to him to wish such beauty for himself. He would have been\nquite contented if the Ducks in the duck-yard had but endured his\ncompany--the poor, ugly creature.\n\nAnd the winter was so cold, so cold, the Duckling was obliged to swim\nround and round in the water to keep it from freezing. But every night\nthe opening in which he swam became smaller and smaller. It froze so\nthat the crust of ice crackled and the Duckling was obliged to make good\nuse of his legs to prevent the water from freezing entirely. At last,\nwearied out, he lay stiff and cold in the ice.\n\nEarly in the morning there passed by a peasant who saw him, broke the\nice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and brought him home to his wife.\n\nThe poor Duckling soon revived. The children would have played with him,\nbut he thought they wished to tease him, and in his terror jumped into\nthe milk-pail, so that the milk was spilled about the room. The good\nwoman screamed and clapped her hands. He flew from there into the pan\nwhere the butter was kept, and thence into the meal-barrel, and out\nagain, and then how strange he looked!\n\nThe woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs, the children ran\nraces with each other trying to catch him, and laughed and screamed\nlikewise. It was well for him that the door stood open. He jumped out\namong the bushes into the new-fallen snow, and there he lay as in a\ndream.\n\nBut it would be too sad to tell all the trouble and misery that he had\nto suffer from the frost, and snow and storms of the winter. He was\nlying on a moor among the reeds, when the sun began to shine warmly\nagain; the larks sang, and beautiful spring had returned.\n\nOnce more he shook his wings. They were stronger than formerly and bore\nhim forward quickly, and before he was well aware of it he was in a\nlarge garden where the apple-trees stood in full bloom, where the\nsyringas sent forth their fragrance and hung their long green branches\ndown into the winding canal. Oh! everything was so lovely, so full of\nthe freshness of spring! And out of the thicket came three beautiful\nwhite Swans. They displayed their feathers so proudly and swam so\nlightly, so lightly! The Duckling knew the glorious creatures, and was\nseized with a strange sadness.\n\n\"I will fly to them, those kingly birds!\" said he. \"They will kill me,\nbecause I, ugly as I am, have dared to approach them. But it matters\nnot. Better to be killed by them than to be bitten by the Ducks, pecked\nby the Hens, kicked by the girl who feeds the poultry, and to have so\nmuch to suffer during the winter!\"\n\nHe flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful creatures. They\nsaw him and shot forward to meet him. \"Only kill me,\" said the poor\ncreature, and he bowed his head low, expecting death. But what did he\nsee in the water? He saw beneath him his own form, no longer that of a\nplump, ugly grey bird--it was that of a Swan.\n\nIt matters not to have been born in a duck-yard, if one has been hatched\nfrom a Swan's egg. And now the Swan began to see the good of all the\ntrouble he had been through. He would never have known how happy he was\nif he had not first had all his sorrow and unhappiness to bear.\n\nThe larger Swans swam round him, and stroked him with their beaks. Some\nlittle children were running about in the garden; they threw grain and\nbread into the water, and the youngest exclaimed: \"There is a new one!\"\nThe others also cried out: \"Yes, a new Swan has come!\" and they clapped\ntheir hands, and danced around.\n\nThey ran to their father and mother, bread and cake were thrown into\nthe water, and every one said: \"The new one is best, so young and so\nbeautiful!\" And the old Swans bowed before him. The young Swan felt\nquite ashamed, and hid his head under his wings. He scarcely knew what\nto do. He was too happy, but still not proud, for a good heart is never\nproud.\n\nHe remembered how he had been persecuted and laughed at, and he now\nheard everyone say that he was the most beautiful of all beautiful\nbirds. The syringas bent down their branches toward him low into the\nwater, and the sun shone warmly and brightly. He shook his feathers,\nstretched his slender neck, and in the joy of his heart said: \"How\nlittle did I dream of so much happiness when I was the despised Ugly\nDuckling!\"\n", "title": "THE UGLY DUCKLING\n"}, {"id": 3, "text": "\u201cSHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,\u201d cried the young Student; \u201cbut in all my garden there is no red rose.\u201d\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\u201cNo red rose in all my garden!\u201d he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.  \u201cAh, on what little things does happiness depend!

Surely Love is a wonderful thing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\nPearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.\u201d\n\u201cThe musicians will sit in their gallery,\u201d said the young Student, \u201cand play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her\u201d; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.\n\u201cWhy is he weeping?\u201d asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\n\u201cHe is weeping for a red rose,\u201d said the Nightingale.\n\u201cFor a red rose?\u201d they cried; \u201chow very ridiculous!\u201d and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student\u2019s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\nShe passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n\u201cGive me a red rose,\u201d she cried, \u201cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\u201d\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\u201cMy roses are white,\u201d it answered; \u201cas white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\u201d\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.\n\u201cGive me a red rose,\u201d she cried, \u201cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\u201d\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\u201cMy roses are yellow,\u201d it answered; \u201cas yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student\u2019s window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\u201d\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student\u2019s window.\n\u201cGive me a red rose,\u201d she cried, \u201cand I will sing you my sweetest song.\u201d\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n\u201cMy roses are red,\u201d it answered, \u201cas red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.\u201d\n\u201cOne red rose is all I want,\u201d cried the Nightingale, \u201conly one red rose!\nIs there no way by which I can get it?\u201d\n\u201cThere is a way,\u201d answered the Tree; \u201cbut it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.\u201d\n\u201cTell it to me,\u201d said the Nightingale, \u201cI am not afraid.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want a red rose,\u201d said the Tree, \u201cyou must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart\u2019s-blood.  You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.\u201d\n\u201cDeath is a great price to pay for a red rose,\u201d cried the Nightingale, \u201cand Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?\u201d\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\n\u201cBe happy,\u201d cried the Nightingale, \u201cbe happy; you shall have your red rose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart\u2019s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.\u201d\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n\u201cSing me one last song,\u201d he whispered; \u201cI shall feel very lonely when you are gone.\u201d\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\u201cShe has form,\u201d he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove\u2014\u201cthat cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am afraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.\u201d\nAnd he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\nAnd on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river\u2014pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n\u201cPress closer, little Nightingale,\u201d cried the Tree, \u201cor the Day will come before the rose is finished.\u201d\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\nBut the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose\u2019s heart remained white, for only a Nightingale\u2019s heart\u2019s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\n\u201cPress closer, little Nightingale,\u201d cried the Tree, \u201cor the Day will come before the rose is finished.\u201d\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\nBut the Nightingale\u2019s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\n\u201cLook, look!\u201d cried the Tree, \u201cthe rose is finished now\u201d; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n\u201cWhy, what a wonderful piece of luck!\u201d he cried; \u201chere is a red rose!  I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name\u201d; and he leaned down and plucked it.\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor\u2019s house with the rose in his hand.\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n\u201cYou said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,\u201d\ncried the Student.  \u201cHere is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.\u201d\nBut the girl frowned.\n\u201cI am afraid it will not go with my dress,\u201d she answered; \u201cand, besides, the Chamberlain\u2019s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.\u201d\n\u201cWell, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\u201d said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.\n\u201cUngrateful!\u201d said the girl.  \u201cI tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don\u2019t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain\u2019s nephew has\u201d; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.\n\u201cWhat a silly thing Love is,\u201d said the Student as he walked away.  \u201cIt is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.\u201d\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.", "title": "THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE\n"}, {"id": 4, "text": "HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.\nHe was very much admired indeed.  \u201cHe is as beautiful as a weathercock,\u201d remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; \u201conly not quite so useful,\u201d he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like the Happy Prince?\u201d asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.  \u201cThe Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,\u201d muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\u201cHe looks just like an angel,\u201d said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said the Mathematical Master, \u201cyou have never seen one.\u201d\n\u201cAh! but we have, in our dreams,\u201d answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\u201cShall I love you?\u201d said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\u201cIt is a ridiculous attachment,\u201d twittered the other Swallows; \u201cshe has no money, and far too many relations\u201d; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\n\u201cShe has no conversation,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.\u201d  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  \u201cI admit that she is domestic,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.\u201d\n\u201cWill you come away with me?\u201d he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.\n\u201cYou have been trifling with me,\u201d he cried.  \u201cI am off to the Pyramids.\nGood-bye!\u201d and he flew away.\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  \u201cWhere shall I put up?\u201d he said; \u201cI hope the town has made preparations.\u201d\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\u201cI will put up there,\u201d he cried; \u201cit is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.\u201d  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\u201cI have a golden bedroom,\u201d he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.  \u201cWhat a curious thing!\u201d he cried; \u201cthere is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.\u201d\nThen another drop fell.\n\u201cWhat is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?\u201d he said; \u201cI must look for a good chimney-pot,\u201d and he determined to fly away.\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw\u2014Ah! what did he see?\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am the Happy Prince.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you weeping then?\u201d asked the Swallow; \u201cyou have quite drenched me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was alive and had a human heart,\u201d answered the statue, \u201cI did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! is he not solid gold?\u201d said the Swallow to himself.  He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\u201cFar away,\u201d continued the statue in a low musical voice, \u201cfar away in a little street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen\u2019s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.\u201d\n\u201cI am waited for in Egypt,\u201d said the Swallow.  \u201cMy friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there himself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.\u201d\n\u201cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cwill you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I like boys,\u201d answered the Swallow.  \u201cLast summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller\u2019s sons, who were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.\u201d\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n\u201cIt is very cold here,\u201d he said; \u201cbut I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince.\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince\u2019s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  \u201cHow wonderful the stars are,\u201d he said to her, \u201cand how wonderful is the power of love!\u201d\n\u201cI hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,\u201d she answered; \u201cI have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.\u201d\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he came to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman\u2019s thimble.\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy\u2019s forehead with his wings.  \u201cHow cool I feel,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI must be getting better\u201d; and he sank into a delicious slumber.\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done.  \u201cIt is curious,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.\u201d\n\u201cThat is because you have done a good action,\u201d said the Prince.  And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always made him sleepy.\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  \u201cWhat a remarkable phenomenon,\u201d said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.  \u201cA swallow in winter!\u201d  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.\n\u201cTo-night I go to Egypt,\u201d said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, \u201cWhat a distinguished stranger!\u201d so he enjoyed himself very much.\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  \u201cHave you any commissions for Egypt?\u201d he cried; \u201cI am just starting.\u201d\n\u201cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cwill you not stay with me one night longer?\u201d\n\u201cI am waited for in Egypt,\u201d answered the Swallow.  \u201cTo-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water\u2019s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.\u201d\n\u201cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cfar away across the city I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.\u201d\n\u201cI will wait with you one night longer,\u201d said the Swallow, who really had a good heart.  \u201cShall I take him another ruby?\u201d\n\u201cAlas!  I have no ruby now,\u201d said the Prince; \u201cmy eyes are all that I have left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.\u201d\n\u201cDear Prince,\u201d said the Swallow, \u201cI cannot do that\u201d; and he began to weep.\n\u201cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cdo as I command you.\u201d\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince\u2019s eye, and flew away to the student\u2019s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird\u2019s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.\n\u201cI am beginning to be appreciated,\u201d he cried; \u201cthis is from some great admirer.  Now I can finish my play,\u201d and he looked quite happy.\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.  \u201cHeave a-hoy!\u201d they shouted as each chest came up.  \u201cI am going to Egypt\u201d! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\u201cI am come to bid you good-bye,\u201d he cried.\n\u201cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cwill you not stay with me one night longer?\u201d\n\u201cIt is winter,\u201d answered the Swallow, \u201cand the chill snow will soon be here.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.\u201d\n\u201cIn the square below,\u201d said the Happy Prince, \u201cthere stands a little match-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.\u201d\n\u201cI will stay with you one night longer,\u201d said the Swallow, \u201cbut I cannot pluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.\u201d\n\u201cSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cdo as I command you.\u201d\nSo he plucked out the Prince\u2019s other eye, and darted down with it.  He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.  \u201cWhat a lovely bit of glass,\u201d cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  \u201cYou are blind now,\u201d he said, \u201cso I will stay with you always.\u201d\n\u201cNo, little Swallow,\u201d said the poor Prince, \u201cyou must go away to Egypt.\u201d\n\u201cI will stay with you always,\u201d said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince\u2019s feet.\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince\u2019s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.\n\u201cDear little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cyou tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.\u201d\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another\u2019s arms to try and keep themselves warm.  \u201cHow hungry we are!\u201d they said.  \u201cYou must not lie here,\u201d shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\u201cI am covered with fine gold,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cyou must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.\u201d\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children\u2019s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.  \u201cWe have bread now!\u201d they cried.\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the baker\u2019s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince\u2019s shoulder once more.  \u201cGood-bye, dear Prince!\u201d he murmured, \u201cwill you let me kiss your hand?\u201d\n\u201cI am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,\u201d said the Prince, \u201cyou have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not to Egypt that I am going,\u201d said the Swallow.  \u201cI am going to the House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?\u201d\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: \u201cDear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow shabby indeed!\u201d cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\u201cThe ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,\u201d said the Mayor in fact, \u201che is litttle better than a beggar!\u201d\n\u201cLittle better than a beggar,\u201d said the Town Councillors.\n\u201cAnd here is actually a dead bird at his feet!\u201d continued the Mayor.  \u201cWe must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.\u201d  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  \u201cAs he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,\u201d said the Art Professor at the University.\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  \u201cWe must have another statue, of course,\u201d he said, \u201cand it shall be a statue of myself.\u201d\n\u201cOf myself,\u201d said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\u201cWhat a strange thing!\u201d said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\n\u201cThis broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it away.\u201d  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.\n\u201cBring me the two most precious things in the city,\u201d said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\u201cYou have rightly chosen,\u201d said God, \u201cfor in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.\u201d\n", "title": "THE HAPPY PRINCE\n"}, {"id": 5, "text": "THE King\u2019s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan\u2019s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.  \u201cShe is like a white rose!\u201d they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\n  [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man kissing the princess\u2019 hand]\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\n\u201cYour picture was beautiful,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut you are more beautiful than your picture\u201d; and the little Princess blushed.\n\u201cShe was like a white rose before,\u201d said a young Page to his neighbour, \u201cbut she is like a red rose now\u201d; and the whole Court was delighted.\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, \u201cWhite rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose\u201d; and the King gave orders that the Page\u2019s salary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that they love each other,\u201d said the little Page, \u201cas clear as crystal!\u201d and the King doubled his salary a second time.  \u201cWhat an honour!\u201d cried all the courtiers.\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, \u201cCharming! charming!\u201d\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\n\u201cWhat are fireworks like?\u201d she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.\n\u201cThey are like the Aurora Borealis,\u201d said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, \u201conly much more natural.\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must certainly see them.\u201d\nSo at the end of the King\u2019s garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.\n\u201cThe world is certainly very beautiful,\u201d cried a little Squib.  \u201cJust look at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one\u2019s prejudices.\u201d\n\u201cThe King\u2019s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,\u201d said a big Roman Candle; \u201cthe world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly.\u201d\n\u201cAny place you love is the world to you,\u201d exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; \u201cbut love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I remember myself once\u2014But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the past.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d said the Roman Candle, \u201cRomance never dies.  It is like the moon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news.\u201d\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  \u201cRomance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,\u201d she murmured.  She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.\n\u201cAhem! ahem!\u201d he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, \u201cRomance is dead.\u201d\n\u201cOrder! order!\u201d cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\n\u201cQuite dead,\u201d whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\n\u201cHow fortunate it is for the King\u2019s son,\u201d he remarked, \u201cthat he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.\u201d\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said the little Squib, \u201cI thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince\u2019s honour.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be so with you,\u201d he answered; \u201cindeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art.\u201d\n\u201cPyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,\u201d said a Bengal Light; \u201cI know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I said Pylotechnic,\u201d answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.\n\u201cI was saying,\u201d continued the Rocket, \u201cI was saying\u2014What was I saying?\u201d\n\u201cYou were talking about yourself,\u201d replied the Roman Candle.\n\u201cOf course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is a sensitive person?\u201d said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\n\u201cA person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people\u2019s toes,\u201d answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.\n\u201cPray, what are you laughing at?\u201d inquired the Rocket; \u201cI am not laughing.\u201d\n\u201cI am laughing because I am happy,\u201d replied the Cracker.\n\u201cThat is a very selfish reason,\u201d said the Rocket angrily.  \u201cWhat right have you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you should be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to give pleasure to others,\u201d cried the Roman Candle, \u201cyou had better keep yourself dry.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; \u201cthat is only common sense.\u201d\n\u201cCommon sense, indeed!\u201d said the Rocket indignantly; \u201cyou forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for myself, I don\u2019t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any hearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.\u201d\n\u201cWell, really,\u201d exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, \u201cwhy not?  It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.\u201d\n\u201cAh! what a trivial view of life!\u201d said the Rocket; \u201cbut it is only what I expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor people, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall never get over it.\u201d\n\u201cBut they have not lost their only son,\u201d said the Roman Candle; \u201cno misfortune has happened to them at all.\u201d\n\u201cI never said that they had,\u201d replied the Rocket; \u201cI said that they might.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.\u201d\n\u201cYou certainly are!\u201d cried the Bengal Light.  \u201cIn fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the rudest person I ever met,\u201d said the Rocket, \u201cand you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t even know him,\u201d growled the Roman Candle.\n\u201cI never said I knew him,\u201d answered the Rocket.  \u201cI dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing to know one\u2019s friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou had really better keep yourself dry,\u201d said the Fire-balloon.  \u201cThat is the important thing.\u201d\n\u201cVery important for you, I have no doubt,\u201d answered the Rocket, \u201cbut I shall weep if I choose\u201d; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.\n\u201cHe must have a truly romantic nature,\u201d said the Catherine Wheel, \u201cfor he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about\u201d; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, \u201cHumbug! humbug!\u201d at the top of their voices.  They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\nThen ten o\u2019clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\n\u201cLet the fireworks begin,\u201d said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  \u201cGood-bye,\u201d\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.\n\u201cI suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,\u201d said the Rocket; \u201cno doubt that is what it means,\u201d and he looked more supercilious than ever.\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  \u201cThis is evidently a deputation,\u201d said the Rocket; \u201cI will receive them with becoming dignity\u201d so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them caught sight of him.  \u201cHallo!\u201d he cried, \u201cwhat a bad rocket!\u201d and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.\n\u201cBAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?\u201d he said, as he whirled through the air; \u201cimpossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same\u201d; and he fell into the mud.\n\u201cIt is not comfortable here,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.\u201d\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.\n\u201cA new arrival, I see!\u201d said the Frog.  \u201cWell, after all there is nothing like mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!\u201d\n\u201cAhem! ahem!\u201d said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\n\u201cWhat a delightful voice you have!\u201d cried the Frog.  \u201cReally it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer\u2019s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer\u2019s wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.\u201d\n\u201cAhem! ahem!\u201d said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.\n\u201cA delightful voice, certainly,\u201d continued the Frog; \u201cI hope you will come over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.\u201d\n\u201cConversation, indeed!\u201d said the Rocket.  \u201cYou have talked the whole time yourself.  That is not conversation.\u201d\n\u201cSomebody must listen,\u201d answered the Frog, \u201cand I like to do all the talking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.\u201d\n\u201cBut I like arguments,\u201d said the Rocket.\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d said the Frog complacently.  \u201cArguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.\n\u201cYou are a very irritating person,\u201d said the Rocket, \u201cand very ill-bred.\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no good talking to him,\u201d said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; \u201cno good at all, for he has gone away.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is his loss, not mine,\u201d answered the Rocket.  \u201cI am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like hearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don\u2019t understand a single word of what I am saying.\u201d\n\u201cThen you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,\u201d said the Dragon-fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\n\u201cHow very silly of him not to stay here!\u201d said the Rocket.  \u201cI am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However, I don\u2019t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day\u201d; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.\n\u201cQuack, quack, quack,\u201d she said.  \u201cWhat a curious shape you are!  May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?\u201d\n\u201cIt is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,\u201d answered the Rocket, \u201cotherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your ignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think much of that,\u201d said the Duck, \u201cas I cannot see what use it is to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something.\u201d\n\u201cMy good creature,\u201d cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, \u201cI see that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is never useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do.\u201d\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, \u201ceverybody has different tastes.  I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.\u201d\n\u201cOh! dear no,\u201d cried the Rocket.  \u201cI am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is neither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.\u201d\n\u201cI had thoughts of entering public life once myself,\u201d remarked the Duck; \u201cthere are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much effect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.\u201d\n\u201cI am made for public life,\u201d said the Rocket, \u201cand so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great attention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one\u2019s mind from higher things.\u201d\n\u201cAh! the higher things of life, how fine they are!\u201d said the Duck; \u201cand that reminds me how hungry I feel\u201d: and she swam away down the stream, saying, \u201cQuack, quack, quack.\u201d\n\u201cCome back! come back!\u201d screamed the Rocket, \u201cI have a great deal to say to you\u201d; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  \u201cI am glad that she has gone,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cshe has a decidedly middle-class mind\u201d; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\n\u201cThis must be the deputation,\u201d said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified.\n\u201cHallo!\u201d cried one of the boys, \u201clook at this old stick!  I wonder how it came here\u201d; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\n\u201cOLD Stick!\u201d said the Rocket, \u201cimpossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he said.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!\u201d\n\u201cLet us put it into the fire!\u201d said the other boy, \u201cit will help to boil the kettle.\u201d\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.\n\u201cThis is magnificent,\u201d cried the Rocket, \u201cthey are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me.\u201d\n\u201cWe will go to sleep now,\u201d they said, \u201cand when we wake up the kettle will be boiled\u201d; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last, however, the fire caught him.\n\u201cNow I am going off!\u201d he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.  \u201cI know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high that\u2014\u201d\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\n\u201cDelightful!\u201d he cried, \u201cI shall go on like this for ever.  What a success I am!\u201d\nBut nobody saw him.\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\n\u201cNow I am going to explode,\u201d he cried.  \u201cI shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.\u201d  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried the Goose.  \u201cIt is going to rain sticks\u201d; and she rushed into the water.\n\u201cI knew I should create a great sensation,\u201d gasped the Rocket, and he went out.", "title": "THE REMARKABLE ROCKET\n"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts. While\nshe was thus engaged and looking out at the snow she pricked her finger,\nand three drops of blood fell upon the snow. Now the red looked so well\nupon the white that she thought to herself, \"Oh, that I had a child as\nwhite as this snow, as red as this blood, and as black as the wood of\nthis frame!\" Soon afterwards a little daughter came to her, who was as\nwhite as snow, and with cheeks as red as blood, and with hair as black\nas ebony, and from this she was named \"Snow-White.\" And at the same time\nher mother died.\n\nAbout a year afterwards the King married another wife, who was very\nbeautiful, but so proud and haughty that she could not bear anyone to be\nbetter-looking than herself. She owned a wonderful mirror, and when she\nstepped before it and said:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit replied:\n\n    \"The Queen is the fairest of the day.\"\n\nThen she was pleased, for she knew that the mirror spoke truly.\n\nLittle Snow-White, however, grew up, and became prettier and prettier,\nand when she was seven years old she was as fair as the noonday, and\nmore beautiful than the Queen herself. When the Queen now asked her\nmirror:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is the fairest, now, they say.\"\n\nThis answer so angered the Queen that she became quite yellow with envy.\nFrom that hour, whenever she saw Snow-White, her heart was hardened\nagainst her, and she hated the little girl. Her envy and jealousy\nincreased so that she had no rest day or night, and she said to a\nHuntsman, \"Take the child away into the forest. I will never look\nupon her again. You must kill her, and bring me her heart and tongue\nfor a token.\"\n\nThe Huntsman listened and took the maiden away, but when he drew out his\nknife to kill her, she began to cry, saying, \"Ah, dear Huntsman, give me\nmy life! I will run into the wild forest, and never come home again.\"\n\nThis speech softened the Hunter's heart, and her beauty so touched him\nthat he had pity on her and said, \"Well, run away then, poor child.\" But\nhe thought to himself, \"The wild beasts will soon devour you.\" Still he\nfelt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart, because her death was\nnot by his hand. Just at that moment a young boar came roaring along to\nthe spot, and as soon as he clapped eyes upon it the Huntsman caught it,\nand, killing it, took its tongue and heart and carried them to the\nQueen, for a token of his deed.\n\nBut now poor little Snow-White was left motherless and alone, and\novercome with grief, she was bewildered at the sight of so many trees,\nand knew not which way to turn. She ran till her feet refused to go\nfarther, and as it was getting dark, and she saw a little house near,\nshe entered in to rest. In this cottage everything was very small, but\nvery neat and elegant. In the middle stood a little table with a white\ncloth over it, and seven little plates upon it, each plate having a\nspoon and a knife and a fork, and there were also seven little mugs.\nAgainst the wall were seven little beds arranged in a row, each covered\nwith snow-white sheets.\n\nLittle Snow-White, being both hungry and thirsty, ate a little morsel of\nporridge out of each plate, and drank a drop or two of wine out of each\nmug, for she did not wish to take away the whole share of anyone. After\nthat, because she was so tired, she laid herself down on one bed, but it\ndid not suit; she tried another, but that was too long; a fourth was too\nshort, a fifth too hard. But the seventh was just the thing; and\ntucking herself up in it, she went to sleep, first saying her prayers\nas usual.\n\nWhen it became quite dark the owners of the cottage came home, seven\nDwarfs, who dug for gold and silver in the mountains. They first\nlighted seven little lamps, and saw at once--for they lit up the whole\nroom--that somebody had been in, for everything was not in the order in\nwhich they had left it.\n\nThe first asked, \"Who has been sitting on my chair?\" The second, \"Who\nhas been eating off my plate?\" The third said, \"Who has been nibbling\nat my bread?\" The fourth, \"Who has been at my porridge?\" The fifth,\n\"Who has been meddling with my fork?\" The sixth grumbled out, \"Who has\nbeen cutting with my knife?\" The seventh said, \"Who has been drinking\nout of my mug?\"\n\nThen the first, looking round, began again, \"Who has been lying on my\nbed?\" he asked, for he saw that the sheets were tumbled. At these words\nthe others came, and looking at their beds cried out too, \"Some one has\nbeen lying in our beds!\" But the seventh little man, running up to his,\nsaw Snow-White sleeping in it; so he called his companions, who shouted\nwith wonder and held up their seven lamps, so that the light fell upon\nthe little girl.\n\n\"Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!\" said they; \"what a beauty she is!\" and they\nwere so much delighted that they would not awaken her, but left her to\nsleep, and the seventh Dwarf, in whose bed she was, slept with each of\nhis fellows one hour, and so passed the night.\n\nAs soon as morning dawned Snow-White awoke, and was quite frightened\nwhen she saw the seven little men; but they were very friendly, and\nasked her what she was called.\n\n\"My name is Snow-White,\" was her reply.\n\n\"Why have you come into our cottage?\" they asked.\n\nThen she told them how her stepmother would have had her killed, but the\nHuntsman had spared her life, and how she had wandered about the Whole\nday until at last she had found their house.\n\nWhen her tale was finished the Dwarfs said, \"Will you look after our\nhousehold--be our cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit for us, and\nkeep everything in neat order? If so, we will keep you here, and you\nshall want for nothing.\"\n\nAnd Snow-White answered, \"Yes, with all my heart and will.\" And so she\nremained with them, and kept their house in order.\n\nIn the morning the Dwarfs went into the mountains and searched for\nsilver and gold, and in the evening they came home and found their meals\nready for them. During the day the maiden was left alone, and therefore\nthe good Dwarfs warned her and said, \"Be careful of your stepmother, who\nwill soon know of your being here. So let nobody enter the cottage.\"\n\nThe Queen meanwhile, supposing that she had eaten the heart and tongue\nof her stepdaughter, believed that she was now above all the most\nbeautiful woman in the world. One day she stepped before her mirror,\nand said:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is fairest now, they say.\n     The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway\n     Amid the forest, far away.\"\n\nThis reply surprised her, but she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.\nShe knew, therefore, that the Huntsman had deceived her, and that\nSnow-White was still alive. So she dyed her face and clothed herself as\na pedler woman, so that no one could recognize her, and in this disguise\nshe went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs. She\nknocked at the door of the hut, and called out, \"Fine goods for sale!\nbeautiful goods for sale!\"\n\nSnow-White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my good woman;\nwhat have you to sell?\"\n\n\"Fine goods, beautiful goods!\" she replied. \"Stays of all colors.\" And\nshe held up a pair which were made of many-colored silks.\n\n\"I may let in this honest woman,\" thought Snow-White; and she unbolted\nthe door and bargained for one pair of stays.\n\n\"You can't think, my dear, how they become you!\" exclaimed the old\nwoman. \"Come, let me lace them up for you.\"\n\nSnow-White suspected nothing, and let her do as she wished, but the old\nwoman laced her up so quickly and so tightly that all her breath went,\nand she fell down like one dead. \"Now,\" thought the old woman to\nherself, hastening away, \"now am I once more the most beautiful of all!\"\n\nAt eventide, not long after she had left, the seven Dwarfs came home,\nand were much frightened at seeing their dear little maid lying on the\nground, and neither moving nor breathing, as if she were dead. They\nraised her up, and when they saw that she was laced too tight they cut\nthe stays to pieces, and presently she began to breathe again, and\nlittle by little she revived. When the Dwarfs now heard what had taken\nplace, they said, \"The old pedler woman was no other than your wicked\nstepmother. Take more care of yourself, and let no one enter when we are\nnot with you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen had reached home, and, going before her mirror, she\nrepeated her usual words:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied as before:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is fairest now, they say.\n     The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway\n     Amid the forest, far away.\"\n\nAs soon as it had finished, all her blood rushed to her heart, for\nshe was so angry to hear that Snow-White was yet living. \"But now,\"\nthought she to herself, \"will I make something which shall destroy her\ncompletely.\" Thus saying, she made a poisoned comb by arts which she\nunderstood, and then, disguising herself, she took the form of an old\nwidow. She went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs,\nand knocking at the door, called out, \"Good wares to sell to-day!\"\n\nSnow-White peeped out and said, \"You must go farther, for I dare not\nlet you in.\"\n\n\"But still you may look,\" said the old woman, drawing out her poisoned\ncomb and holding it up. The sight of this pleased the maiden so much\nthat she allowed herself to be persuaded, and opened the door. As soon\nas she had bought something the old woman said, \"Now let me for once\ncomb your hair properly,\" and Snow-White consented. But scarcely was\nthe comb drawn through the hair when the poison began to work, and the\nmaiden fell down senseless.\n\n\"You pattern of beauty,\" cried the wicked Queen, \"it is now all over\nwith you.\" And so saying, she departed.\n\nFortunately, evening soon came, and the seven Dwarfs returned, and as\nsoon as they saw Snow-White lying, like dead, upon the ground, they\nsuspected the Queen, and discovering the poisoned comb, they immediately\ndrew it out. Then the maiden very soon revived and told them all that\nhad happened. So again they warned her against the wicked stepmother,\nand bade her open the door to nobody.\n\nMeanwhile the Queen, on her arrival home, had again consulted her\nmirror, and received the same answer as twice before. This made her\ntremble and foam with rage and jealousy, and she swore that Snow-White\nshould die if it cost her her own life. Thereupon she went into an inner\nsecret chamber where no one could enter, and made an apple of the most\ndeep and subtle poison. Outwardly it looked nice enough, and had rosy\ncheeks which would make the mouth of everyone who looked at it water;\nbut whoever ate the smallest piece of it would surely die. As soon as\nthe apple was ready the Queen again dyed her face, and clothed herself\nlike a peasant's wife, and then over the seven mountains to the house of\nthe seven Dwarfs she made her way.\n\nShe knocked at the door, and Snow-White stretched out her head and said,\n\"I dare not let anyone enter; the seven Dwarfs have forbidden me.\"\n\n\"That is hard on me,\" said the old woman, \"for I must take back my\napples; but there is one which I will give you.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Snow-White; \"no, I dare not take it.\"\n\n\"What! are you afraid of it?\" cried the old woman. \"There, see--I will\ncut the apple in halves; do you eat the red cheeks, and I will eat the\ncore.\" (The apple was so artfully made that the red cheeks alone were\npoisoned.) Snow-White very much wished for the beautiful apple, and\nwhen she saw the woman eating the core she could no longer resist, but,\nstretching out her hand, took the poisoned part. Scarcely had she placed\na piece in her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground. Then the\nQueen, looking at her with glittering eyes, and laughing bitterly,\nexclaimed, \"White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony! This time\nthe Dwarfs cannot reawaken you.\"\n\nWhen she reached home and consulted her mirror--\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit answered:\n\n    \"The Queen is fairest of the day.\"\n\n\nThen her envious heart was at rest, as peacefully as an envious heart\ncan rest.\n\nWhen the little Dwarfs returned home in the evening they found\nSnow-White lying on the ground, and there appeared to be no life in\nher body; she seemed to be quite dead. They raised her up, and tried\nif they could find anything poisonous. They unlaced her, and even\nuncombed her hair, and washed her with water and with wine. But\nnothing availed: the dear child was really and truly dead.\n\nThen they laid her upon a bier, and all seven placed themselves around\nit, and wept and wept for three days without ceasing. Then they prepared\nto bury her. But she looked still fresh and life-like, and even her red\ncheeks had not deserted her, so they said to one another, \"We cannot\nbury her in the black ground.\" Then they ordered a case to be made of\nglass. In this they could see the body on all sides, and the Dwarfs\nwrote her name with golden letters upon the glass, saying that she was\na King's daughter. Now they placed the glass case upon the ledge on a\nrock, and one of them always remained by it watching. Even the birds\nbewailed the loss of Snow-White; first came an owl, then a raven, and\nlast of all a dove.\n\nFor a long time Snow-White lay peacefully in her case, and changed not,\nbut looked as if she were only asleep, for she was still white as snow,\nred as blood, and black-haired as ebony. By and by it happened that a\nKing's son was traveling in the forest, and came to the Dwarfs' house\nto pass the night. He soon saw the glass case upon the rock, and the\nbeautiful maiden lying within, and he read also the golden inscription.\n\nWhen he had examined it, he said to the Dwarfs, \"Let me have this case,\nand I will pay what you like for it.\"\n\nBut the Dwarfs replied, \"We will not sell it for all the gold in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Then give it to me,\" said the Prince; \"for I cannot live without\nSnow-White. I will honor and protect her as long as I live.\"\n\nWhen the Dwarfs saw that he was so much in earnest, they pitied him,\nand at last gave him the case, and the Prince ordered it to be carried\naway on the shoulders of his attendants. Presently it happened that\nthey stumbled over a rut, and with the shock the piece of poisoned\napple which lay in Snow-White's mouth fell out. Very soon she opened\nher eyes, and raising the lid of the glass case, she rose up and asked,\n\"Where am I?\"\n\nFull of joy, the Prince answered, \"You are safe with me.\" And he told\nto her what she had suffered, and how he would rather have her than any\nother for his wife, and he asked her to accompany him home to the castle\nof the King his father. Snow-White consented, and when they arrived\nthere they were married with great splendor and magnificence.\n\nSnow-White's stepmother was also invited to the wedding, and when she\nwas dressed in all her finery to go, she first stepped in front of her\nmirror and asked:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     The Prince's bride is now, they say.\"\n\nAt these words the Queen was in a fury, and was so terribly mortified\nthat she knew not what to do with herself. At first she resolved not\nto go to the wedding, but she could not resist the wish to see the\nPrincess. So she went; but as soon as she saw the bride she recognized\nSnow-White, and was so terrified with rage and astonishment that she\nrushed out of the castle and was never heard of again.\n", "title": "LITTLE SNOW-WHITE\n"}]
