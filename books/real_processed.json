[{"text": "It was beautiful in the country. It was summertime. The wheat was\nyellow, the oats were green, the hay was stacked up in the green\nmeadows, and the stork paraded about on his long red legs, talking\nin Egyptian, which language he had learnt from his mother.\n\nThe fields and meadows were skirted by thick woods, and a deep lake lay\nin the midst of the woods. Yes; it was indeed beautiful in the country!\nThe sunshine fell warmly on an old mansion, surrounded by deep canals,\nand from the walls down to the water's edge there grew large burdock\nleaves, so high that children could stand upright among them without\nbeing seen.\n\nThis place was as wild as the thickest part of the wood, and on that\naccount a Duck had chosen to make her nest there. She was sitting on\nher eggs; but the pleasure she had felt at first was now almost gone,\nbecause she had been there so long, and had so few visitors, for the\nother Ducks preferred swimming on the canals to sitting among the\nburdock leaves gossiping with her.\n\nAt last the eggs cracked one after another, \"Chick, chick!\" All the eggs\nwere alive, and one little head after another peered forth. \"Quack,\nquack!\" said the Duck, and all got up as well as they could. They peeped\nabout from under the green leaves; and as green is good for the eyes,\ntheir mother let them look as long as they pleased.\n\n\"How large the world is!\" said the little ones, for they found their new\nabode very different from their former narrow one in the egg-shells.\n\n\"Do you imagine this to be the whole of the world?\" said the mother.\n\"It extends far beyond the other side of the garden in the pastor's\nfield; but I have never been there. Are you all here?\" And then she got\nup. \"No, not all, for the largest egg is still here. How long will this\nlast? I am so weary of it!\" And then she sat down again.\n\n\"Well, and how are you getting on?\" asked an old Duck, who had come to\npay her a visit.\n\n\"This one egg keeps me so long,\" said the mother. \"It will not break.\nBut you should see the others! They are the prettiest little Ducklings\nI have seen in all my days. They are all like their father--the\ngood-for-nothing fellow, he has not been to visit me once!\"\n\n\"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the old Duck. \"Depend\nupon it, it is a turkey's egg. I was cheated in the same way once\nmyself, and I had such trouble with the young ones; for they were afraid\nof the water, and I could not get them there. I called and scolded, but\nit was all of no use. But let me see the egg--ah, yes! to be sure, that\nis a turkey's egg. Leave it, and teach the other little ones to swim.\"\n\n\"What is the Matter?\" asked the Old Woman]\n\n\"I will sit on it a little longer,\" said the Duck. \"I have been sitting\nso long, that I may as well spend the harvest here.\"\n\n\"It is no business of mine,\" said the old Duck, and away she waddled.\n\nThe great egg burst at last. \"Chick! chick!\" said the little one, and\nout it tumbled--but, oh! how large and ugly it was! The Duck looked at\nit. \"That is a great, strong creature,\" said she. \"None of the others\nare at all like it. Can it be a young turkey-cock? Well, we shall soon\nfind out. It must go into the water, though I push it in myself.\"\n\nThe next day there was delightful weather, and the sun shone warmly upon\nthe green leaves when Mother Duck with all her family went down to the\ncanal. Plump she went into the water. \"Quack! quack!\" cried she, and one\nduckling after another jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but\nall came up again, and swam together quite easily. Their legs moved\nwithout effort. All were there, even the ugly grey one.\n\n\"No; it is not a turkey,\" said the old Duck; \"only see how prettily it\nmoves its legs, how upright it holds itself! It is my own child. It is\nalso really very pretty, when you look more closely at it. Quack! quack!\nnow come with me, I will take you into the world and introduce you in\nthe duck-yards. But keep close to me, or someone may tread on you; and\nbeware of the Cat.\"\n\nSo they came into the duck-yard. There was a horrid noise; two families\nwere quarreling about the head of an eel, which in the end was carried\noff by the Cat.\n\n\"See, my children, such is the way of the world,\" said the Mother Duck,\nwiping her beak, for she, too, was fond of eels. \"Now use your legs,\"\nsaid she, \"keep together, and bow to the old Duck you see yonder. She\nis the most distinguished of all the fowls present, and is of Spanish\nblood, which accounts for her dignified appearance and manners. And\nlook, she has a red rag on her leg! That is considered extremely\nhandsome, and is the greatest honor a Duck can have. Don't turn your\nfeet inwards; a well-educated Duckling always keeps his legs far apart,\nlike his father and mother, just so--look! Now bow your necks, and say,\n'Quack.'\"\n\nAnd they did as they were told. But the other Ducks, who were in the\nyard, looked at them and said aloud, \"Just see! Now we have another\nbrood, as if there were not enough of us already. And fie! how ugly\nthat one is. We will not endure it.\" And immediately one of the Ducks\nflew at him, and bit him in the neck.\n\n\"Leave him alone,\" said the mother. \"He is doing no one any harm.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is so large and so strange-looking, and therefore he shall\nbe teased,\" said the others.\n\n\"Those are fine children that our good mother has,\" said the old Duck\nwith the red rag on her leg. \"All are pretty except one, and that has\nnot turned out well; I almost wish it could be hatched over again.\"\n\n\"That cannot be, please your Highness,\" said the mother. \"Certainly he\nis not handsome, but he is a very good child, and swims as well as the\nothers, indeed, rather better. I think he will grow like the others all\nin good time, and perhaps will look smaller. He stayed so long in the\negg-shell, that is the cause of the difference.\" And she scratched the\nDuckling's neck, and stroked his whole body. \"Besides,\" added she, \"he\nis a Drake. I think he will be very strong, so it does not matter so\nmuch. He will fight his way through.\"\n\n\"The other Ducks are very pretty,\" said the old Duck. \"Pray make\nyourselves at home, and if you find an eel's head you can bring it\nto me.\"\n\nSo they made themselves at home.\n\nBut the poor little Duckling, who had come last out of its egg-shell,\nand who was so ugly, was bitten, pecked, and teased by both Ducks and\nHens. \"It is so large!\" said they all. And the Turkey-cock, who had come\ninto the world with spurs on, and therefore fancied he was an emperor,\npuffed himself up like a ship in full sail, and marched up to the\nDuckling quite red with passion. The poor little thing scarcely knew\nwhat to do. He was quite distressed, because he was so ugly, and\nbecause he was the jest of the poultry-yard.\n\nSo passed the first day, and afterwards matters grew worse and\nworse--the poor Duckling was scorned by all. Even his brothers and\nsisters behaved unkindly, and were constantly saying, \"May the Cat take\nyou, you nasty creature!\" The mother said, \"Ah, if you were only far\naway!\" The Ducks bit him, the Hens pecked him, and the girl who fed the\npoultry kicked him.\n\nHe ran through the hedge, and the little birds in the bushes were\nterrified. \"That is because I am so ugly,\" thought the Duckling,\nshutting his eyes, but he ran on. At last he came to a wide moor,\nwhere lived some Wild Ducks; here he lay the whole night, very tired\nand comfortless. In the morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and saw their\nnew companion. \"Pray who are you?\" asked they; and our little Duckling\nturned himself in all directions, and greeted them as politely as\npossible.\n\n\"You are really uncommonly ugly!\" said the Wild Ducks. \"However, that\ndoes not matter to us, provided you do not marry into our families.\"\nPoor thing! he had never thought of marrying; he only begged permission\nto lie among the reeds, and drink the water of the moor.\n\nThere he lay for two whole days. On the third day there came two Wild\nGeese, or rather Ganders, who had not been long out of their egg-shells,\nwhich accounts for their impertinence.\n\n\"Hark ye,\" said they; \"you are so ugly that we like you very well. Will\nyou come with us and be a bird of passage? On another moor, not far\nfrom this, are some dear, sweet Wild Geese, as lovely creatures as have\never said 'Hiss, hiss.' You are truly in the way to make your fortune,\nugly as you are.\"\n\nBang! a gun went off all at once, and both Wild Geese were stretched\ndead among the reeds; the water became red with blood. Bang! a gun went\noff again. Whole flocks of Wild Geese flew up from among the reeds, and\nanother report followed.\n\nThere was a grand hunting party. The hunters lay in ambush all around;\nsome were even sitting in the trees, whose huge branches stretched far\nover the moor. The blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist,\nand was dispersed as it fell over the water. The hounds splashed about\nin the mud, the reeds and rushes bent in all directions.\n\nHow frightened the poor little Duck was! He turned his head, thinking\nto hide it under his wings, and in a moment a most formidable-looking\nDog stood close to him, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes\nsparkling fearfully. He opened wide his jaws at the sight of our\nDuckling, showing him his sharp white teeth, and, splash, splash!\nhe was gone--gone without hurting him.\n\n\"Well! let me be thankful,\" sighed he. \"I am so ugly that even the Dog\nwill not eat me.\"\n\nAnd now he lay still, though the shooting continued among the reeds,\nshot following shot.\n\nThe noise did not cease till late in the day, and even then the poor\nlittle thing dared not stir. He waited several hours before he looked\naround him, and then hurried away from the moor as fast as he could.\nHe ran over fields and meadows, though the wind was so high that he\nhad some difficulty in moving.\n\nTowards evening he reached a wretched little hut, so wretched that it\nknew not on which side to fall, and therefore remained standing. The\nwind blew violently, so that our poor little Duckling was obliged to\nsupport himself on his tail, in order to stand against it; but it\nbecame worse and worse. He then noticed that the door had lost one\nof its hinges, and hung so much awry that he could creep through the\ncrack into the room. So he went in.\n\nIn this room lived an old woman, with her Tom-cat and her Hen. The Cat,\nwhom she called her little son, knew how to set up his back and purr;\nindeed, he could even throw out sparks when stroked the wrong way. The\nHen had very short legs, and was therefore called \"Chickie Short-legs.\"\nShe laid very good eggs, and the old woman loved her as her own child.\n\nThe next morning the new guest was discovered, and the Cat began to mew\nand the Hen to cackle.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the old woman, looking round. But her eyes\nwere not good, so she took the young Duckling to be a fat Duck who had\nlost her way. \"This is a capital catch,\" said she, \"I shall now have\nDuck's eggs, if it be not a Drake. We shall see.\"\n\nAnd so the Duckling was kept on trial for three weeks, but no eggs made\ntheir appearance. Now the Cat was the master of the house, and the Hen\nwas the mistress, and always used to say, \"We and the world,\" for they\nimagined themselves to be not only the half of the world, but also by\nfar the better half. The Duckling thought it was possible to be of a\ndifferent opinion, but that the Hen would not allow.\n\n\"Can you lay eggs?\" asked she.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, then, hold your tongue.\"\n\nAnd the Cat said, \"Can you set up your back? Can you purr?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you should have no opinion when reasonable people are\nspeaking.\"\n\nSo the Duckling sat alone in a corner, and felt very miserable. However,\nhe happened to think of the fresh air and bright sunshine, and these\nthoughts gave him such a strong desire to swim again, that he could not\nhelp telling it to the Hen.\n\n\"What ails you?\" said the Hen. \"You have nothing to do, and therefore\nbrood over these fancies. Either lay eggs or purr, then you will forget\nthem.\"\n\n\"But it is so delicious to swim!\" said the Duckling. \"So delicious when\nthe waters close over your head, and you plunge to the bottom!\"\n\n\"Well, that is a queer sort of pleasure,\" said the Hen. \"I think you\nmust be crazy. Not to speak of myself, ask the Cat--he is the most\nsensible animal I know--whether he would like to swim, or to plunge to\nthe bottom of the water. Ask our mistress, the old woman--there is no\none in the world wiser than she. Do you think she would take pleasure\nin swimming and in the waters closing over her head?\"\n\n\"You do not understand me,\" said the Duckling.\n\n\"What! we do not understand you? So you think yourself wiser than the\nCat and the old woman, not to speak of myself? Do not fancy any such\nthing, child; but be thankful for all the kindness that has been shown\nyou. Are you not lodged in a warm room, and have you not the advantage\nof society from which you can learn something? But you are a simpleton,\nand it is wearisome to have anything to do with you. Believe me, I wish\nyou well. I tell you unpleasant truths, but it is thus that real\nfriendship is shown. Come, for once give yourself the trouble to\nlearn to purr, or to lay eggs.\"\n\n\"I think I will go out into the wide world again,\" said the Duckling.\n\n\"Well, go,\" answered the Hen.\n\nSo the Duckling went. He swam on the surface of the water, he plunged\nbeneath, but all animals passed him by, on account of his ugliness. And\nthe autumn came, the leaves turned yellow and brown, the wind caught\nthem and danced them about, the air was very cold, the clouds were heavy\nwith hail or snow, and the Raven sat on the hedge and croaked. The poor\nDuckling was certainly not very comfortable.\n\nOne evening, just as the sun was setting with unusual brilliancy, a\nflock of large, beautiful birds rose from out of the brushwood. The\nDuckling had never seen anything so beautiful before; their plumage was\nof a dazzling white, and they had long, slender necks. They were Swans.\nThey uttered a singular cry, spread out their long splendid wings, and\nflew away from these cold regions to warmer countries, across the open\nsea. They flew so high, so very high! And the little Ugly Duckling's\nfeelings were so strange. He turned round and round in the water like a\nmill-wheel, strained his neck to look after them, and sent forth such a\nloud and strange cry that it almost frightened himself. Ah! he could not\nforget them, those noble birds, those happy birds! When he could see\nthem no longer he plunged to the bottom of the water, and when he rose\nagain was almost beside himself. The Duckling knew not what the birds\nwere called, knew not whither they were flying; yet he loved them as he\nhad never before loved anything. He envied them not; it would never have\noccurred to him to wish such beauty for himself. He would have been\nquite contented if the Ducks in the duck-yard had but endured his\ncompany--the poor, ugly creature.\n\nAnd the winter was so cold, so cold, the Duckling was obliged to swim\nround and round in the water to keep it from freezing. But every night\nthe opening in which he swam became smaller and smaller. It froze so\nthat the crust of ice crackled and the Duckling was obliged to make good\nuse of his legs to prevent the water from freezing entirely. At last,\nwearied out, he lay stiff and cold in the ice.\n\nEarly in the morning there passed by a peasant who saw him, broke the\nice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and brought him home to his wife.\n\nThe poor Duckling soon revived. The children would have played with him,\nbut he thought they wished to tease him, and in his terror jumped into\nthe milk-pail, so that the milk was spilled about the room. The good\nwoman screamed and clapped her hands. He flew from there into the pan\nwhere the butter was kept, and thence into the meal-barrel, and out\nagain, and then how strange he looked!\n\nThe woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs, the children ran\nraces with each other trying to catch him, and laughed and screamed\nlikewise. It was well for him that the door stood open. He jumped out\namong the bushes into the new-fallen snow, and there he lay as in a\ndream.\n\nBut it would be too sad to tell all the trouble and misery that he had\nto suffer from the frost, and snow and storms of the winter. He was\nlying on a moor among the reeds, when the sun began to shine warmly\nagain; the larks sang, and beautiful spring had returned.\n\nOnce more he shook his wings. They were stronger than formerly and bore\nhim forward quickly, and before he was well aware of it he was in a\nlarge garden where the apple-trees stood in full bloom, where the\nsyringas sent forth their fragrance and hung their long green branches\ndown into the winding canal. Oh! everything was so lovely, so full of\nthe freshness of spring! And out of the thicket came three beautiful\nwhite Swans. They displayed their feathers so proudly and swam so\nlightly, so lightly! The Duckling knew the glorious creatures, and was\nseized with a strange sadness.\n\n\"I will fly to them, those kingly birds!\" said he. \"They will kill me,\nbecause I, ugly as I am, have dared to approach them. But it matters\nnot. Better to be killed by them than to be bitten by the Ducks, pecked\nby the Hens, kicked by the girl who feeds the poultry, and to have so\nmuch to suffer during the winter!\"\n\nHe flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful creatures. They\nsaw him and shot forward to meet him. \"Only kill me,\" said the poor\ncreature, and he bowed his head low, expecting death. But what did he\nsee in the water? He saw beneath him his own form, no longer that of a\nplump, ugly grey bird--it was that of a Swan.\n\nIt matters not to have been born in a duck-yard, if one has been hatched\nfrom a Swan's egg. And now the Swan began to see the good of all the\ntrouble he had been through. He would never have known how happy he was\nif he had not first had all his sorrow and unhappiness to bear.\n\nThe larger Swans swam round him, and stroked him with their beaks. Some\nlittle children were running about in the garden; they threw grain and\nbread into the water, and the youngest exclaimed: \"There is a new one!\"\nThe others also cried out: \"Yes, a new Swan has come!\" and they clapped\ntheir hands, and danced around.\n\nThey ran to their father and mother, bread and cake were thrown into\nthe water, and every one said: \"The new one is best, so young and so\nbeautiful!\" And the old Swans bowed before him. The young Swan felt\nquite ashamed, and hid his head under his wings. He scarcely knew what\nto do. He was too happy, but still not proud, for a good heart is never\nproud.\n\nHe remembered how he had been persecuted and laughed at, and he now\nheard everyone say that he was the most beautiful of all beautiful\nbirds. The syringas bent down their branches toward him low into the\nwater, and the sun shone warmly and brightly. He shook his feathers,\nstretched his slender neck, and in the joy of his heart said: \"How\nlittle did I dream of so much happiness when I was the despised Ugly\nDuckling!\"\n", "title": "THE UGLY DUCKLING\n"}, {"text": "Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were\nfalling like feathers from the clouds, a Queen sat at her palace window,\nwhich had an ebony black frame, stitching her husband's shirts. While\nshe was thus engaged and looking out at the snow she pricked her finger,\nand three drops of blood fell upon the snow. Now the red looked so well\nupon the white that she thought to herself, \"Oh, that I had a child as\nwhite as this snow, as red as this blood, and as black as the wood of\nthis frame!\" Soon afterwards a little daughter came to her, who was as\nwhite as snow, and with cheeks as red as blood, and with hair as black\nas ebony, and from this she was named \"Snow-White.\" And at the same time\nher mother died.\n\nAbout a year afterwards the King married another wife, who was very\nbeautiful, but so proud and haughty that she could not bear anyone to be\nbetter-looking than herself. She owned a wonderful mirror, and when she\nstepped before it and said:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit replied:\n\n    \"The Queen is the fairest of the day.\"\n\nThen she was pleased, for she knew that the mirror spoke truly.\n\nLittle Snow-White, however, grew up, and became prettier and prettier,\nand when she was seven years old she was as fair as the noonday, and\nmore beautiful than the Queen herself. When the Queen now asked her\nmirror:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is the fairest, now, they say.\"\n\nThis answer so angered the Queen that she became quite yellow with envy.\nFrom that hour, whenever she saw Snow-White, her heart was hardened\nagainst her, and she hated the little girl. Her envy and jealousy\nincreased so that she had no rest day or night, and she said to a\nHuntsman, \"Take the child away into the forest. I will never look\nupon her again. You must kill her, and bring me her heart and tongue\nfor a token.\"\n\nThe Huntsman listened and took the maiden away, but when he drew out his\nknife to kill her, she began to cry, saying, \"Ah, dear Huntsman, give me\nmy life! I will run into the wild forest, and never come home again.\"\n\nThis speech softened the Hunter's heart, and her beauty so touched him\nthat he had pity on her and said, \"Well, run away then, poor child.\" But\nhe thought to himself, \"The wild beasts will soon devour you.\" Still he\nfelt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart, because her death was\nnot by his hand. Just at that moment a young boar came roaring along to\nthe spot, and as soon as he clapped eyes upon it the Huntsman caught it,\nand, killing it, took its tongue and heart and carried them to the\nQueen, for a token of his deed.\n\nBut now poor little Snow-White was left motherless and alone, and\novercome with grief, she was bewildered at the sight of so many trees,\nand knew not which way to turn. She ran till her feet refused to go\nfarther, and as it was getting dark, and she saw a little house near,\nshe entered in to rest. In this cottage everything was very small, but\nvery neat and elegant. In the middle stood a little table with a white\ncloth over it, and seven little plates upon it, each plate having a\nspoon and a knife and a fork, and there were also seven little mugs.\nAgainst the wall were seven little beds arranged in a row, each covered\nwith snow-white sheets.\n\nLittle Snow-White, being both hungry and thirsty, ate a little morsel of\nporridge out of each plate, and drank a drop or two of wine out of each\nmug, for she did not wish to take away the whole share of anyone. After\nthat, because she was so tired, she laid herself down on one bed, but it\ndid not suit; she tried another, but that was too long; a fourth was too\nshort, a fifth too hard. But the seventh was just the thing; and\ntucking herself up in it, she went to sleep, first saying her prayers\nas usual.\n\nWhen it became quite dark the owners of the cottage came home, seven\nDwarfs, who dug for gold and silver in the mountains. They first\nlighted seven little lamps, and saw at once--for they lit up the whole\nroom--that somebody had been in, for everything was not in the order in\nwhich they had left it.\n\nThe first asked, \"Who has been sitting on my chair?\" The second, \"Who\nhas been eating off my plate?\" The third said, \"Who has been nibbling\nat my bread?\" The fourth, \"Who has been at my porridge?\" The fifth,\n\"Who has been meddling with my fork?\" The sixth grumbled out, \"Who has\nbeen cutting with my knife?\" The seventh said, \"Who has been drinking\nout of my mug?\"\n\nThen the first, looking round, began again, \"Who has been lying on my\nbed?\" he asked, for he saw that the sheets were tumbled. At these words\nthe others came, and looking at their beds cried out too, \"Some one has\nbeen lying in our beds!\" But the seventh little man, running up to his,\nsaw Snow-White sleeping in it; so he called his companions, who shouted\nwith wonder and held up their seven lamps, so that the light fell upon\nthe little girl.\n\n\"Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!\" said they; \"what a beauty she is!\" and they\nwere so much delighted that they would not awaken her, but left her to\nsleep, and the seventh Dwarf, in whose bed she was, slept with each of\nhis fellows one hour, and so passed the night.\n\nAs soon as morning dawned Snow-White awoke, and was quite frightened\nwhen she saw the seven little men; but they were very friendly, and\nasked her what she was called.\n\n\"My name is Snow-White,\" was her reply.\n\n\"Why have you come into our cottage?\" they asked.\n\nThen she told them how her stepmother would have had her killed, but the\nHuntsman had spared her life, and how she had wandered about the Whole\nday until at last she had found their house.\n\nWhen her tale was finished the Dwarfs said, \"Will you look after our\nhousehold--be our cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit for us, and\nkeep everything in neat order? If so, we will keep you here, and you\nshall want for nothing.\"\n\nAnd Snow-White answered, \"Yes, with all my heart and will.\" And so she\nremained with them, and kept their house in order.\n\nIn the morning the Dwarfs went into the mountains and searched for\nsilver and gold, and in the evening they came home and found their meals\nready for them. During the day the maiden was left alone, and therefore\nthe good Dwarfs warned her and said, \"Be careful of your stepmother, who\nwill soon know of your being here. So let nobody enter the cottage.\"\n\nThe Queen meanwhile, supposing that she had eaten the heart and tongue\nof her stepdaughter, believed that she was now above all the most\nbeautiful woman in the world. One day she stepped before her mirror,\nand said:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is fairest now, they say.\n     The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway\n     Amid the forest, far away.\"\n\nThis reply surprised her, but she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.\nShe knew, therefore, that the Huntsman had deceived her, and that\nSnow-White was still alive. So she dyed her face and clothed herself as\na pedler woman, so that no one could recognize her, and in this disguise\nshe went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs. She\nknocked at the door of the hut, and called out, \"Fine goods for sale!\nbeautiful goods for sale!\"\n\nSnow-White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my good woman;\nwhat have you to sell?\"\n\n\"Fine goods, beautiful goods!\" she replied. \"Stays of all colors.\" And\nshe held up a pair which were made of many-colored silks.\n\n\"I may let in this honest woman,\" thought Snow-White; and she unbolted\nthe door and bargained for one pair of stays.\n\n\"You can't think, my dear, how they become you!\" exclaimed the old\nwoman. \"Come, let me lace them up for you.\"\n\nSnow-White suspected nothing, and let her do as she wished, but the old\nwoman laced her up so quickly and so tightly that all her breath went,\nand she fell down like one dead. \"Now,\" thought the old woman to\nherself, hastening away, \"now am I once more the most beautiful of all!\"\n\nAt eventide, not long after she had left, the seven Dwarfs came home,\nand were much frightened at seeing their dear little maid lying on the\nground, and neither moving nor breathing, as if she were dead. They\nraised her up, and when they saw that she was laced too tight they cut\nthe stays to pieces, and presently she began to breathe again, and\nlittle by little she revived. When the Dwarfs now heard what had taken\nplace, they said, \"The old pedler woman was no other than your wicked\nstepmother. Take more care of yourself, and let no one enter when we are\nnot with you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen had reached home, and, going before her mirror, she\nrepeated her usual words:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied as before:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     Snow-White is fairest now, they say.\n     The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway\n     Amid the forest, far away.\"\n\nAs soon as it had finished, all her blood rushed to her heart, for\nshe was so angry to hear that Snow-White was yet living. \"But now,\"\nthought she to herself, \"will I make something which shall destroy her\ncompletely.\" Thus saying, she made a poisoned comb by arts which she\nunderstood, and then, disguising herself, she took the form of an old\nwidow. She went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs,\nand knocking at the door, called out, \"Good wares to sell to-day!\"\n\nSnow-White peeped out and said, \"You must go farther, for I dare not\nlet you in.\"\n\n\"But still you may look,\" said the old woman, drawing out her poisoned\ncomb and holding it up. The sight of this pleased the maiden so much\nthat she allowed herself to be persuaded, and opened the door. As soon\nas she had bought something the old woman said, \"Now let me for once\ncomb your hair properly,\" and Snow-White consented. But scarcely was\nthe comb drawn through the hair when the poison began to work, and the\nmaiden fell down senseless.\n\n\"You pattern of beauty,\" cried the wicked Queen, \"it is now all over\nwith you.\" And so saying, she departed.\n\nFortunately, evening soon came, and the seven Dwarfs returned, and as\nsoon as they saw Snow-White lying, like dead, upon the ground, they\nsuspected the Queen, and discovering the poisoned comb, they immediately\ndrew it out. Then the maiden very soon revived and told them all that\nhad happened. So again they warned her against the wicked stepmother,\nand bade her open the door to nobody.\n\nMeanwhile the Queen, on her arrival home, had again consulted her\nmirror, and received the same answer as twice before. This made her\ntremble and foam with rage and jealousy, and she swore that Snow-White\nshould die if it cost her her own life. Thereupon she went into an inner\nsecret chamber where no one could enter, and made an apple of the most\ndeep and subtle poison. Outwardly it looked nice enough, and had rosy\ncheeks which would make the mouth of everyone who looked at it water;\nbut whoever ate the smallest piece of it would surely die. As soon as\nthe apple was ready the Queen again dyed her face, and clothed herself\nlike a peasant's wife, and then over the seven mountains to the house of\nthe seven Dwarfs she made her way.\n\nShe knocked at the door, and Snow-White stretched out her head and said,\n\"I dare not let anyone enter; the seven Dwarfs have forbidden me.\"\n\n\"That is hard on me,\" said the old woman, \"for I must take back my\napples; but there is one which I will give you.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Snow-White; \"no, I dare not take it.\"\n\n\"What! are you afraid of it?\" cried the old woman. \"There, see--I will\ncut the apple in halves; do you eat the red cheeks, and I will eat the\ncore.\" (The apple was so artfully made that the red cheeks alone were\npoisoned.) Snow-White very much wished for the beautiful apple, and\nwhen she saw the woman eating the core she could no longer resist, but,\nstretching out her hand, took the poisoned part. Scarcely had she placed\na piece in her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground. Then the\nQueen, looking at her with glittering eyes, and laughing bitterly,\nexclaimed, \"White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony! This time\nthe Dwarfs cannot reawaken you.\"\n\nWhen she reached home and consulted her mirror--\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nit answered:\n\n    \"The Queen is fairest of the day.\"\n\n\nThen her envious heart was at rest, as peacefully as an envious heart\ncan rest.\n\nWhen the little Dwarfs returned home in the evening they found\nSnow-White lying on the ground, and there appeared to be no life in\nher body; she seemed to be quite dead. They raised her up, and tried\nif they could find anything poisonous. They unlaced her, and even\nuncombed her hair, and washed her with water and with wine. But\nnothing availed: the dear child was really and truly dead.\n\nThen they laid her upon a bier, and all seven placed themselves around\nit, and wept and wept for three days without ceasing. Then they prepared\nto bury her. But she looked still fresh and life-like, and even her red\ncheeks had not deserted her, so they said to one another, \"We cannot\nbury her in the black ground.\" Then they ordered a case to be made of\nglass. In this they could see the body on all sides, and the Dwarfs\nwrote her name with golden letters upon the glass, saying that she was\na King's daughter. Now they placed the glass case upon the ledge on a\nrock, and one of them always remained by it watching. Even the birds\nbewailed the loss of Snow-White; first came an owl, then a raven, and\nlast of all a dove.\n\nFor a long time Snow-White lay peacefully in her case, and changed not,\nbut looked as if she were only asleep, for she was still white as snow,\nred as blood, and black-haired as ebony. By and by it happened that a\nKing's son was traveling in the forest, and came to the Dwarfs' house\nto pass the night. He soon saw the glass case upon the rock, and the\nbeautiful maiden lying within, and he read also the golden inscription.\n\nWhen he had examined it, he said to the Dwarfs, \"Let me have this case,\nand I will pay what you like for it.\"\n\nBut the Dwarfs replied, \"We will not sell it for all the gold in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Then give it to me,\" said the Prince; \"for I cannot live without\nSnow-White. I will honor and protect her as long as I live.\"\n\nWhen the Dwarfs saw that he was so much in earnest, they pitied him,\nand at last gave him the case, and the Prince ordered it to be carried\naway on the shoulders of his attendants. Presently it happened that\nthey stumbled over a rut, and with the shock the piece of poisoned\napple which lay in Snow-White's mouth fell out. Very soon she opened\nher eyes, and raising the lid of the glass case, she rose up and asked,\n\"Where am I?\"\n\nFull of joy, the Prince answered, \"You are safe with me.\" And he told\nto her what she had suffered, and how he would rather have her than any\nother for his wife, and he asked her to accompany him home to the castle\nof the King his father. Snow-White consented, and when they arrived\nthere they were married with great splendor and magnificence.\n\nSnow-White's stepmother was also invited to the wedding, and when she\nwas dressed in all her finery to go, she first stepped in front of her\nmirror and asked:\n\n    \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,\n     Who is the fairest of us all?\"\n\nand it replied:\n\n    \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;\n     The Prince's bride is now, they say.\"\n\nAt these words the Queen was in a fury, and was so terribly mortified\nthat she knew not what to do with herself. At first she resolved not\nto go to the wedding, but she could not resist the wish to see the\nPrincess. So she went; but as soon as she saw the bride she recognized\nSnow-White, and was so terrified with rage and astonishment that she\nrushed out of the castle and was never heard of again.\n", "title": "LITTLE SNOW-WHITE\n"}]
